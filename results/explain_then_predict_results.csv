"""The Kurds"" are an ethnic group, with a similar mix of people as any other. There are many Kurds in ISIS. When you're describing ""The Kurds,"" you're conflating many different groups with different agendas and ideologies, to the point that they have openly fought each other in the past. For example, you cite women's rights, when Kurdish areas have some of the highest rates of Female Genital Mutilation of anywhere in the world. The YPG in Syria are a socialist/communist movement with a high regard for women's rights, but they are drastically different from the Iraqi Kurds. The same PKK fighters that might save the Yizidis one month are placing fake emergency calls and shooting/kidnapping the police and nurses who respond the next.

I am extremely sympathetic to the cause of the YPG in particular, but I feel like your view is unduly influenced by the way the western media has simplified and thereby misrepresented the situation in the middle east. ","&gt;1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region.

First of all, there are a number of other actors which does subscribe to woman's rights. Turkey for example has opposition leftist parties which supports women's rights. Israel is also another example of a western valued country in the region.

&gt;2) They care about more than just themselves.


I feel that this part is based on an incredibly....optimistic view of the Kurds.

Kurdish middlemen, including Kurdish political leaders are quite willing to work with ISIS when there's material gains involved. See their involvement with helping ISIS to sell oil for instance:

http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6c269c4e-5ace-11e4-b449-00144feab7de.html#axzz3hJfQSOhy

Every single political group in the Middle-East are largely motivated by material gains. Even incredibly ideological groups have bottom lines. The Kurds are fighting ISIS because they are a threat to Kurdistan, if ISIS wasn't a threat to the Kurds, the Kurds wouldn't fight them even if they are committing genocide.

&gt;3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.

Turkey isn't even too different from the US in the 1980s in this regard, who cooperated with Islamic extremists to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. 

People are primarily motivated by realistic geopolitics in the region. It's awfully problematic to attribute actions to ""morals"" or ideology when there are so many strange bedfellows if you look at ideology. 

Syria for instance is allied with Iran despite Syria being a nominally secular, atheistic state and Iran is a theocracy. 

Saudi Arabia, the most Islamist country in the region and Egypt are also close despite the fact that the current dictator (let's just admit it) of Egypt came to power on the promise that he will save the country from the Islamists. 

Israel, a western, Jewish state and Saudi Arabia, a country which don't allow Jews into the country, have a defacto alliance against Iran. And Israel sees the Saudis as a stabilizer in the Gulf.

Overall, I think you underestimate how self-interested people are, if the day comes when the Kurds needs to cooperate with ISIS (say against the Iraqi central government), they will do it to guarantee their own survival.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more detailed and nuanced perspective on the Kurds, highlighting the complexities and contradictions within the Kurdish groups. It addresses the oversimplification of the situation in the Middle East and challenges the OP's view by presenting a more realistic and critical analysis of the Kurds. Response 2, on the other hand, focuses more on generalizations and comparisons with other countries in the region, without delving into the specific issues and conflicts within the Kurdish groups.",0
"Actually 2040 isn't a bad estimate. [In 2012 California passed a law to legalize the testing of autonomous cars on public roads](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/09/robot-cars-now-officially-legal-in-california/), as long as there was a passenger on board and there were manual controls just in case. [Just last year their DMV finished creation of the policies](http://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/05/california-approves-rules-for-testing-self-driving-cars-in-california/) to enforce and implement that new law. [And companies like Nissan](http://fortune.com/2014/01/10/just-how-close-to-commercial-reality-is-a-self-driving-car/) are already planning have commercial models available as soon as 2020. We already have plenty of cars that advertise self parking, automatic braking and warning in case the car detects it's about to rear end or reverse into an obstacle... fully autonomy isn't that far off. Do I think self driving cars will be the prevailing motor vehicle by 2040? Probably not, but technology gets adopted so quickly that who knows. But there will be plenty of commercial options (likely for the more wealthy) by then for sure. ","Have you looked into googles plans for self driving cars? they are not semi-automated, there is no options for manual control. Their ideal plans are less of ""everyone buys and owns a self driving car"", and more along the lines of ""there are now robot taxi's that everyone will use because they are so safe"".


If things go well, I expect there to be a lot of public money invested into self driving cars. Huge safety increases, plus the ability to reduce parking spaces in urban centers is just too attractive. You might be right in that they wont be ""commercially available"", but they will probably be the only(or vast majority of) cars on the road well before 2040.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides concrete examples and evidence of the progress being made in the development of self-driving cars, including the passing of laws in California and plans by companies like Nissan to have commercial models available as soon as 2020. This evidence-based approach is likely more persuasive in changing the OP's view.",0
"&gt; This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect.

I think you will find that as a parent, this would be an impossible situation. You say that ""respect needs to be earned"", but isn't this a two way street? Maybe you think the parent who says ""because I said so"" hasn't done enough to earn the child's respect. But has the child done anything to earn respect either? If the parent tried to rationally explain why they're right to the child, how confident are you that the child will understand and ""can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out"". If they can't, then a rational two-way discussion just isn't going to happen.

And if such a discussion can't happen yet, what now? Should the parent and child just ""agree to disagree""? Of course not. I wouldn't frame it as some kind of ""debt"" that arises out of giving birth, but I think its pretty widely acknowledged that parents are responsible for their child's behavior, even before the child is wise enough to understand complicated reasoning. As a third part, I *expect* other parents to keep their children in line, even if their children aren't smart enough to understand why certain behavioral expectations exist.

And similar phenomena happen for all positions of authority. If a police officer is directing traffic, he doesn't have to explain to you the details of what's going on. You have to listen to him anyway. ""Because I said so"" would be a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say when him explaining what's going on in more detail would hold up traffic (especially if you then decide for whatever reason that you disagree). Similarly, there are many employer-employee relationships where ""because I said so"" should be good enough for you. One hopes that there is a good reason behind the requests, but the employee is in no way entitled to a full breakdown of exactly why everything works the way it does, especially when time is of the essence. Its embedded into the nature of these relationships that you follow orders.","In principle, I agree with you that parents do not simply deserve unconditional respect just by virtue of being their parents. But there are several aspects that I'd like to comment on.

First of all, your parents changed your diapers and by the time you're even just 5, they've invested a whole lot of time and money in you. That is enough to deserve some respect and gratitude. That doesn't mean they can't lose it because they do crappy things, but it is worth quite a bit in itself, and it does deserve respect.

In the case of arguments, there's two points that I think are important. First of all, you'll have found that there are many situations in life where ""because I said so"" is something you'll have to submit to if you want to achieve certain goals. Ever had a job? Ever had a boss who told you what to do? Did they always talk you through the reasons for the required actions step by step? It would be nice if they did, because even in a job I'd quite like to know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but they're not required to because they give you money.

If your parents say you can't wear a cap at the table because they said so, then that's fair enough. They're feeding you. You're free to get up and move out and buy your own food, but as long as they're providing for you, they can make rules, even if the rules are stupid and arbitrary and you don't agree with them. I personally don't think that's a very good attitude and I hope I won't be that kind of parent, but I can't really argue with it.

Also, I've had similar conversations with parents because, as I said, I do in principle agree with you, and I'd very much like to be a parent who explains things to their children and encourages them not to take things for granted or as given without questioning them. But I've been told that this just gets tedious sometimes. Maybe you spend 15 hours a day actively dealing with your child. Children ask all the questions and want to do all the things, and if you at some point run out of patience and don't want to explain something for the nth time, I think saying ""because I said so"" is still not ideal, but perfectly understandable. 

With your last statement, I'm not sure which age you have in mind. But people of any age really sometimes suck at logic, and children even more so, so there are arguments that can't be solved this way because no side will admit out of their own accord that they're wrong. And in some cases there isn't even necessarily wrong or right, because it depends on how much you care about certain things. You can't drag arguments out forever. You need to get on with your life at some point. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 presents a strong argument by highlighting the importance of authority figures and the necessity of following orders in certain situations. It also addresses the idea that respect is a two-way street and questions whether the child has done anything to earn respect as well. By providing examples of other authority figures like police officers and employers, Response 2 effectively argues that sometimes explanations are not necessary and that following orders is a part of life.",0
"If we can make them then it's highly probable that there are natural processes that can also produce them. The problem is that we very rarely see or can measure the conditions that might possibly produce them. So, we don't (rather, can't with current capabilities) know if, when, and where these things might exist in nature.

I know it strokes our ego to think that these things are completely artificial and could only possibly exist due to human activity, that is probably not the case. Our understanding of these subjects are so lacking that we don't even appreciate how ignorant we actually are.","You've already addressed a bunch of points here, but I don't think anyone's yet addressed the Island of Stability, a proposed group of superheavy isotopes (possibly around element 126ish) with extraordinary stability relative to their neighbors (no telling whether they'll be able to exist on a macroscopic scale).

If you decided to declare more ephemeral nuclides ""not elements"" (a view I am very glad you have abandoned), then you're cultivating an artificial gap between stable natural elements and ""stable"" transuranics.",2,2,True,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it challenges the notion that superheavy isotopes can only exist artificially due to human activity. By pointing out that our understanding of natural processes is limited and that we may not have the capability to detect these isotopes in nature, it opens up the possibility that they could occur naturally. This challenges the original view that superheavy isotopes are purely artificial.",0
"If someone uses the ""backdoor"" to my bathroom lock, I both know about it when it happens, and have, presumably, consented to it, and it is being done for my best interests.

Government surveillance is done in secret. We can't review their behaviour to ensure it is in line with our values and interests. Nor is it done with consent, even in the larger sense of requiring a warrant granted in open and public court.

Most importantly, it is not done in our best interests. A bathroom may be breached if the occupant is having a heart attack, but there is absolutely no danger to me from my own communications.","The arguments against surveillance are nearly always about indiscriminate, mass surveillance.  Nobody really has a problem with targeted surveillance.  If the government has a warrant to search your house or listen to your phone calls, they can do so.  But getting a warrant requires individualized probable cause to believe that you have committed a crime.

In the analogy, using a pin to open the door is an action that is only taken in extremis to violate the privacy of the occupant for some more important purpose.  Likewise, the government should only use its surveillance powers to violate privacy when there is a strong reason to target the particular person(s) being surveilled.",1,1,True,"Response 1 is more persuasive because it directly addresses the key concerns about government surveillance, such as lack of consent, lack of transparency, and lack of alignment with the individual's best interests. It also effectively highlights the difference between a physical breach of privacy in an emergency situation versus government surveillance of communications.",0
"Your statement is sort of useless because ""God"" means so many different things to different people. The statement becomes hopelessly vague because Alice and Bob can hold vastly different beliefs which can both be summed up in the statement ""I believe God created the universe"".

From where I stand, what you are really saying is ""IF you believe God can be anything AND you have no clue what God is, THEN there is no difference between believing you don't know how the universe came in to being, and believing that God brought the universe in to being"". It really becomes a question of definition, which in this case is entirely subjective. You can probably find a formal definition for God which makes your statement ""true"", but it will still not reflect actual people's actual belief.","There are lots of things we don't know, we will never know this for a certainty.

However if you say that God created the universe then you 'know' that. People who admit that ""All that I know is that I know nothing"" are honest. Shit happens, and what created God?",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more detailed breakdown of the OP's argument and highlights the vagueness and subjectivity of the statement ""I believe God created the universe."" It also points out the issue of different interpretations of God, making a strong case for why the statement is not as meaningful as it may seem.",0
"Some of your points seem to stem from the fact that you're simply more comfortable with cutlery. Like the one about food falling. That still can happen with cutlery. Eating with manners? Table manners are cultural.

As a personal thing, even though I don't eat much Asian food I do like that chopsticks are a one handed affair, since I cannot grasp anything with my left hand. Something like cutting meat with cutlery is actually harder than using chopsticks.",Many Chinese (and other East Asian) dishes use meat in smaller pieces which still contain the bone. Chopsticks are superior for grabbing the bone and then eating the meat portion. Eating a Chinese-cut BBQ duck with a knife and fork is a much more frustrating exercise than simply picking up the piece by the bone. ,2,2,True,"Response 2 addresses the OP's concerns about comfort and food falling, pointing out that these issues can still occur with cutlery. Additionally, the mention of table manners being cultural helps to show that the preference for chopsticks over cutlery is subjective and not necessarily based on practicality alone. The personal anecdote about chopsticks being easier for someone with limited hand mobility adds a relatable and empathetic touch to the argument.",0
"&gt; I believe that as long as everyone has the freedom to climb the socioeconomic ladder rung by rung, that the only difference is between those that take the opportunity and those that don't and the reason why many people remain in poverty is because they lack the motivation to take the necessary steps, be it because they don't have peers pushing them to do so or because they would prefer to work a minimum wage job instead of applying for better positions--I can't say.

What I don't like about this view is that it makes it seem so simple to get out of poverty.  ""'Just Do It' is all you need to fix your financial problems!""

Its hard to explain but poverty saps you.   Its a struggle just to keep your head above water and the waves are getting bigger and bigger and your are getting more and more tired.  

For example http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/29/poverty-mental-capacity-complex-tasks  

&gt;The cognitive deficit of being preoccupied with money problems was equivalent to a loss of 13 IQ points, losing an entire night's sleep or being a chronic alcoholic, according to the study. The authors say this could explain why poorer people are more likely to make mistakes or bad decisions that exacerbate their financial difficulties.

Its very hard to figure out what to do, organize yourself to do it, do it and then take advantage of it when you are sapped out.  Is the motivation you are asking of people unrealistic?  

","&gt; I come from a wealthy family and have had very little experience with people from the lower socioeconomic spectrum, which probably shapes my view of the wealth ladder and how one climbs from rung to rung.

This is all you needed to say. You lived in a higher income area with schools that were better funded. Your parents could give you attention and guidance instead of working multiple jobs. You probably made some connections along the way. All of this will get you into a better college with better prospects. You weren't more motivated, you were just lucky.

The real nail in the coffin is that there are more people than there are well-paying jobs. Even if everybody were ultra-motivated hard-workers, there would be the same amount of people making minimum wage. You can't really live on minimum wage.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more nuanced and empathetic perspective on the challenges of climbing the socioeconomic ladder. It acknowledges the mental and emotional toll that poverty takes on individuals, making it difficult for them to simply ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps."" By providing scientific evidence and personal anecdotes, Response 2 effectively highlights the complexities of escaping poverty, which is more likely to resonate with the OP.",0
"I generally agree with you, but you are wrong on point #3.

&gt; If the power goes out, you want the things that need to stay the coldest to be on the bottom. Heat rises, and so it makes sense to keep the frozen items on the bottom so that if your power goes out, they will stay cold the longest.

Heat rises to the top *within a closed system*. The fridge and freezer are separated from each other, so the heat will only rise to the top of the insulated compartment regardless of the configuration. Even if there is leakage between compartments, the temperature difference of air *within the unit* would be insignificant.","Top freezers are a simpler design. The way fridges are designed, all the cooling takes place in the freezer. There is a thermocouple in the fridge measuring the temperature. When the fridge reaches a certain temperature, a vent opens between the two compartments to let the cold air into the fridge section. If the freezer is on top, the air will flow freely downwards due to the denser cold air displacing the warmer air in the fridge. If the freezer is on the bottom, a fan is needed to drive the exchange. It will be more expensive to operate. 


That being said, I have a bottom freezer and I find the convenience outweighs the extra cost.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a clear and logical explanation debunking one of the points made in Response 1. By addressing a specific point and providing a scientific explanation, Response 2 adds credibility to the argument against bottom freezers.",0
"So I do think this policy I justified, but I don't think it's a good mechanism for mandatory vaccination.

The people who insist on not vaccinating their children do so because they think it would be harmful for their child, and some of them probably hold this belief strong enough so that they would not enroll their children in school. Are anti-vaxxers really the people you want homeschooling children? The comparison here is, with mandatory vaccinations, hundreds of kids have their lives ruined by leaving school each year. Without them, maybe once every decade, less than a hundred kids will get sick for a few weeks. 

But the problem is also worse than that, because this also plays into a lot of anti-vaxxer rhetoric. A lot of it relies on exploiting people's fears of the government. Mandatory vaccines only make that seem worse. Additionally, it makes these people even less trusting of the government, meaning that they are more likely to shut themselves of from outside streams of information. So it forces many anti-vaxxers into even more of an echo chamber. One of the must successful ways to spread information is to have anti-vaxxers have a friend or a neighbor who can discuss these things with them. The easiest way to prevent that from happening is by forcing them further away from the rest of society.","As much as I hate defending the anti-vaccine crowd, I think the problem with mandatory vaccination for public school is that school is also compulsory. Ever since No Child Left Behind, education has been mandatory for all children until 16 or 18 (can't remember). Now the same people who demandon't children be sent to school also demand that in order to go to school, they must be vaccinated. 

Now, now you might say, that's only for public schools, what about private schools and home/eschooling? There's a problem with that too. Roughly 40% of children in the US live in single parent home, which rules out the prospect of homeschooling and eschooling becomes unviable because it's illegal to leave your kids alone at home. You also have a large percentage of the population who can't afford or don't have access to private schools. The amount of overlap here has the potential to be very high, especially in poor neighborhoods. 

So, now we have a segment of the population for whom public school is the only option. What are the odds that some of these people do not want their kids vaccinated, for whatever reason (ignorance usually, but that's not the point)? Pretty high. So now the question becomes, are we willing to fine and or imprison parents because they don't want their kid to get a vaccine and therefore won't send them to school? Personally, that is not something I'm willing to do, so I'm against mandatory vaccination in order to go to school.",2,2,True,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it addresses the concerns of the OP regarding mandatory vaccination in schools by highlighting the potential negative consequences of pushing anti-vaxxers to homeschool their children. It also brings up the issue of reinforcing anti-vaxxer beliefs and creating more distrust in the government, which could lead to further isolation and echo chambers. This response provides a more nuanced perspective on the issue and considers the broader implications of mandatory vaccination policies.",0
"OP, while there are certainly assholes out there, many with loud vehicles are not. If you and your community feel that they are problems, lobby your local government to legally lower the appropriate noise ordinance and have the police solve the problem. If your community doesn't agree with you, sadly your options are restricted to moving or insulating your home to the level where outside noise does not bother you.

Personally, I drive a loud car (for performance reasons) which I have used to increase my technical skills. I have taken precautions so that my car isn't as loud as it could be (resonators and a muffler), but it can still be loud. Because of this, I am very careful when driving through residential areas and ensure that I drive in a higher gear to limit the noise I make (lower revs = less noise). I live near an area with strict noise ordinances and have never had a problem because I am considerate of others. 

Basically, my point is that I (and others in this thread) am proof that not all operators of loud vehicles are inconsiderate assholes. There certainly are inconsiderate assholes, but a blanket labeling of all those who operate loud vehicles is using the same logic that a racist uses to justify their bigotry. Blanket generalizations are generally fallacious because there is almost always someone who doesn't fit into those generalizations. In this regard, I believe your CMV should be changed to say that people who purposefully aim to disrupt the lives of others by being unnecessarily loud are inconsiderate assholes, because that's taking into account the people who aren't inconsiderate assholes.","I own 3 cars with no catalytic converters and a high flow muffler and one car has no mufflers or anything. The reason I do this is because I am an enthusiast that has cars that are heavily modified. Restricted exhausts also restrict performance, especially on turbocharged cars. Cruising and at idle they are all not that bad, when you get on it they are loud. I don't do this because I'm an inconsiderate asshole, I do it because I like it, and most people modify their cars for their liking. I always drive down my own street at a low rpm because I am considerate of my neighbors. If you live near a busy street you have to live with the noise. People who modify their cars to be loud don't know that you have a baby that's trying to sleep when you're living next to a busy street. You can't expect people to be considerate of you just because you chose to have a kid and live where you do. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it acknowledges the issue at hand while also providing a solution and offering a different perspective. The response also uses personal experience to show that not all loud car owners are inconsiderate, which can help change the OP's view on the matter.",0
"*Nearly all* of your supporting ideas for why NYC sucks are byproducts of population.  Basically you're saying everyone wants to live there, so there are many people there and so as a result it's a bad place to live.  *At best* you're only telling half of the story.

I live in NYC and I also love Boston.  Both are great cities, but here are some things that I prefer about NYC.

(1) Entertainment. You can join a club to watch endless Broadway plays and productions for *dirt cheap*.  Some of the finest museums on the planet are here.  

(2) There is business on top of business in NYC.  If you're an entrepreneur, you can't walk down the street without finding some opportunity or another.

(3) If you want to do yoga or martial arts or stuntman training or anything else you can possibly think of, there are more options for each one than anywhere else.  

(4) Restaurants.  New ones spring up *all of the time*.  Also partially motivated by the cost of operation, bad ones die quickly.  It's survival of the fittest.  Do you want a cheeseburger at 5:00 AM?  No problem.  Do you want authentic Nigerian food?  Done.  How about world class, award winning BBQ?  Yep.  

(5) Diversity.  You can meet people from any part of the world, just about everywhere you go.

(6) Dating/Nightlife.  There are more events to visit than there will be nights in your life. There are more people, opportunities and events centered around dating than anywhere else I can think of.

(7) Careers.  NYC costs more, and if you're not doing at least *ok* financially then it hurts.  But assuming that you have a college education, the jobs here pay a lot more than the jobs elsewhere.  

(8)  Politics.  We have and proactive political centers.  Everything from protests to celebrations.

(9) Education.  We have excellent ~~schools~~ *universities*.  


Honestly I could go on forever, but NYC has a lot of great traits.  If a person does not make use of the resources available, then they're probably better off in a place where they don't have to pay as much to live there.  But for those interested, NYC has a lot of things that are just not available in many other places including Boston.","If NYC sucked then people wouldn't want to live here. But 8.5 million do. And just going by the costs of housing, millions more would love to but can't. Are all those people wrong?

Most of the negatives you're listing are byproducts of size. Whenever you get this kind of density you're going to get crowds, traffic, and problems with dirt and trash. What you're missing is the upside of that kind of density.

Let's say you've got something you like that only 1 in 1,000 people are into. Maybe it's a particular kind of cuisine, maybe it's a niche hobby, maybe it's an oddball sport, maybe it's a political outlook or cause you care about.

In a city of 8.5 million (and a metro area of nearly 20 million) that's still going to be 850-2,000 people who enjoy the same thing. That's enough to get a well attended meetup going around the hobby. 

Literally anything you might be into, anything you'd ever want to try, any kind of unique experience you can imagine can be found in NYC because the population is there to make it viable. Do you live entertainment like music, bands, comedy, dance, theater, poetry reading? NYC has got all of that ranging from amateur nights to world class performances. Do you like ethnic food? I guarantee you NYC has anything you can name, made by someone from that country. Name whatever you can think of, search for a meetup, and you'll find a bunch of people that love it as much as you do.

A further note, you complain about how crowded the subways are - and they are! - but consider that NYC is one of just a handful of 24 hour train systems *in the world*, as well as one of the largest. It links together 300 square miles and makes it possible for all these disparate people to get together with one another and makes the city feel like a cohesive whole. 

If you come to NYC you *will* find a community to be a part of that'll make it feel like home. There's very few other places can promise that.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a detailed list of specific benefits and positive aspects of living in NYC, addressing each of the negatives brought up by the OP.

"I'm not going to try to convince you but maybe put some things in perspective.

I don't think anyone is truly qualified enough to be able to convince you. But here's my two cents anyhow.

I believe this subject is more complicated than it seems because historical evidence doesn't really count here. I say that mainly due to the fact that we have the internet. Just this alone and the fact that technology is improving at such a fast pace. Makes any kind of prediction really impossible. 

Economically speaking China and America need each other as of right now. China has artificially suppressed their currency in order for them to remain cheap so that they can remain the worlds biggest supplier. This is very important to them as any increase in currency value could cause millions to lose jobs due to (shipping + manufacturing costs &gt; producing locally). They have been using america for that as mentioned by other users, by buying american treasury bills and printing more yuan to dilute their economy. I personally feel this has contributed a lot to the 'dying middle class' heard a lot in america. After all isn't this kind of similar to a time when walmart was on the rise and wrecking small businesses? I don't know where to classify this but it does seem like this is causing a lot of distress in America and if this isn't one way China is influencing things in the america I don't know what is. That being said I may be wrong since I'm no cultural expert. 

Then again I have alternate theories on how China might also dominate through the mobile markets. Recently Mediatek(China) has produced some android chips that are beating Qualcomm in terms of the size of their chip. Don't want to go to technical details but (smaller chipset= lower power consumption for same tasks on mobile devices). Maybe they might start flooding the US markets with their cheap but value for money mobile devices. We never know With the internet could happen faster than we think and that would give them some kind of influence right? Considering the amount of time we spend on our mobile devices these days.

I also believe that this cultural advantage america still maintains is due to the leading of the mobile industry by Steve jobs. If China had been the first to develop and market the smartphone well. The world might have been very different. So maybe they invent something that the whole world adopts.

All these are random speculations. But hopefully gave you some new perspective. If I'm wrong about any facts do tell. ","I think you are correct that one of the elements to international power and prestige is cultural influence. Every great power needs to have both to get into the game. Culture writ large is not just media or fashion. But scientific and artistic. Germany never rose to the poison as premier country in Europe even though it had immense economic, military and cultural power and prestige in the late 19th and 20th centuries. It's cultural import was the equal or greater than that of its rivals.  China does not have the mass cultural influence of Japan or even Korea. It's best students seek to learn abroad, and many stay abroad. The biggest impediment to China's rise as a cultural power is the lack of political freedom. You could say that European counties achieved cultural hegemony with limited democracy, but all the counties were limited in their freedom at the time. China needs to compete on a cultural level with one hand tied behind its back. It's economy which is open in some ways but still directed and controlled in many important ways. The problem is that communist party can not open itself up politically without endangering it's own survival. The wealth that party members and their families have amassed is based on political connections and state controls that would be under pressure from a political opening. 

But if China were able to open itself up politically the cultural flood gates would open dramatically. China's history shows that for the vast majority of its history it has proven to be able to be a cultural hegemon, through art and science. It's enormous market alone will prove to develop its own world beating cultures. But here is the biggest problem.

"So leaving aside the Whiggish narrative of history in the first half of your post being wrong (states do not always go from decentralized to centralized in a nice linear fashion), there's a lot of reasons why a unified Europe remains, at best, a pipe dream.

First, the economic angle. The economies of Europe are vastly different in output. Germany is an economic powerhouse. Greece can't pay its debts. Most of the rest are somewhere in the middle. So you'd need all these disparate economies to agree to pay their share of taxes, which will inevitably be unequal, as will who reaps the benefits. Germany is already unhappy about how badly they've been burnt down in Greece. Imagine if that was a yearly occurrence.

The second issue, you touched on yourself. Compatibility. In East Europe, you have countries like Poland who get very nervous when people start talking about doing things to their national sovereignty. In West Europe, you've got hatreds that run back hundreds of years. In the Balkans, I'm sure the Slavs will jump at the chance for another unified government, and the Greeks and the Turks will have no issues at all being in the same ""country"".

Finally a large unified government is going to be a bureaucratic nightmare. First, you'll encounter the West Lothian question writ large. Are the Germans going to let Greeks have an equal say in how this hypothetical government's money is spent? How about the French? Are the Irish going to be happy haggling over a budget with the English? Will the Spainards be likely to listen to the Finns when it comes down to how to divvy up the tax? The Balkans alone would be an absolute fucking nightmare. Second, you're going to have to find a way to nail all the various forms of government in Europe together into something every other country is happy with. What do you do with the British Monarchy, for instance? At election time, how are you going to convince Portugal to accept votes from Romania (whose ballet boxes may or may not be stuffed).  At least you have INTERPOL for cops, but how are you building a military here? An intelligence agency? And then you have to hold it together. A single major economic crisis was enough to threaten the EU, and if this thing disintegrates, the consequences will be much, much worse.

And all these are internal issues. They ignore the international side (how does Russia react? What about China?) of things. Unifying Europe into one central government is a morass of issues. If it happens, it will happen very, very slowly, with large amounts of not entirely unjustified resistance.
","how many primary languages are there in the USA? i would say somewhere in the estimate of.... 1.

you can't do the same for Europe where everything is completely different - money/currency, religions, general lifestyle.

"Dogs are AWESOME. A few benefits: 

* Having dogs makes the owner significantly more likely to be sufficiently [physically active](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2156050/). From the study: ""odds of achieving sufficient physical activity and walking were 57% to 77% higher among dog owners compared with those not owning dogs..."" This is backed up [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379705003995) and [here](http://journals.humankinetics.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/17134.pdf) and in many, many other studies.

* Dogs are extremely helpful in reducing the healthcare costs of the elderly. [Proof](http://jah.sagepub.com/content/20/4/437.short): ""Interaction between humans and dogs is a mechanism that can enhance the physical and psychological health of elderly citizens and promote a social support network between dog owners. In turn, dependence and impact on health and social services are alleviated.""

* Owning pets is extremely beneficial for [one's psychological health](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-13783-001/). From the study: ""owners enjoyed better well-being when their pets fulfilled social needs better, and the support that pets provided complemented rather than competed with human sources.""

There are more benefits, like the fact that pets make owners laugh a lot, etc. But I'd like to talk about a few things you've brought up:

&gt; They are annoying.

Well-trained dogs aren't annoying at all. In fact, dogs are highly intelligent and respond very well to training. Some owners are worse than others is all. Responsible owners know the benefits of training their dogs.

&gt; They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable.

You're assuming that all the resources that are used to produce dog food would be magically transferred to alleviating global hunger - that's unlikely to happen. 

So, what do you think?

Edit: fixed link","I'll hit your relevant ones first:

&gt; They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them!

That article it basing a lot of that greenhouse gas emission off of a primarily meat based diet...which a lot of dogs don't usually have.  Most people I know primarily feed their dogs non-meat based food.  Take [Purina](http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/purina-pro-plan-dog-food-selects-dry/) for example, it's mostly fish product (less greenhouse producing compared to land based meats) and grains.  A lot of the meats that also go into dog food are byproducts of human meat consumption as well...so it's not like there are farms of animals specifically for dog food.

IMO, this article is pretty weaksauce.

&gt; They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. 

It's logistics.  People are going to starve regardless if you have pets or kids or if you live high on the hog eating steaks every night.  Having a pet is irrelevant to other people starving.  The food and resources going into a dog probably won't ever make it to these people unless you actively choose to spend your time and money diverting resources to starving people rather than have a pet.

&gt; Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day.

It's companionship more than entertainment.  If you're a good pet owner this is a mutually beneficial life for both parties.  

&gt; Some dogs are plain dangerous

Not any more dangerous than people, or other wild animals.  And a well trained dog with a proper owner wouldn't have issues like this.

&gt; They are annoying

See above.  A well trained dog with a proper owner doesn't have issues with barking or bothering people.  Proper owners also clean up after their pets.

&gt; They eat poo

Only if you let them.  A baby would eat poo too if it got hold of some and you weren't paying attention.

TL;DR.  It seems like a lot of these issues are a symptom of poor training and irresponsible owners.  You should be against careless owners rather than saying a blanket statement of ""no one should own dogs"".",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides concrete evidence and studies to support the benefits of owning dogs, such as increased physical activity and reduced healthcare costs for the elderly.

"If you don't have a desire to exceed professionally, continue the path you are on.  I'm going to be brutally honest with you in hopes you'll change your thought process and make you realize you aren't the shining star of intelligence and superiority you think you are.

I was in your shoes in high school.  I saw people around me busting their ass for good grades, struggling with exams, participating in extra-curricular activities, all in efforts to get into a good university.  I could skate by in high school by doing the bare minimum, ace exams without studying, and after having my ego inflated by teachers over the years I simply felt I was better than everyone else.  It couldn't be further from the truth and I learned this slowly through my years at a university while meeting people not only more motivated than me, but smarter than me as well.

It's easy to have a sense of superiority in high school which you clearly have by saying you'd excel at a top university when you can't put in the basic time and effort to complete basic high school responsibilities. 

Successful individuals aren't people who are smart with a thirst for knowledge.  They're people who are not only smart, but driven in ways you couldn't possibly fathom.  Successful people have motors.  They do what needs to get done, regardless of how they feel about the task.  There is no task that you are above - you've earned nothing thus far.  Regardless of what you decide to do in life, you'll be met with tasks that seem menial and unnecessary. Successful people will take these tasks in stride with a grin on their face because they know it leads them to the end game they're trying to achieve.

You're a smart, well spoken person. That isn't worth a fucking dime if you can't apply it and get work done even if you can't stand the work.  You have a choice, continue to slack in key parts of your life that can lead you to rewarding success, or you can lead your life thinking you're above school work and useless tasks.  One will result in a rewarding, challenging, successful lifestyle regardless of financial success.  The other will end with a narcissistic adult thinking they're owed something because they can program in their parent's basement but can't put in the work ethic to provide value to anyone.

**If you want to get motivated and get your shit together to pursue a rewarding lifestyle and get out of this giant mistake of a hole you're digging, PM me. I was in your shoes once and I was lucky to be surrounded by people who woke me the fuck up. I'd be more than happy to do the same with you.**

","You think you will excel at a top university? I doubt it. University will be a lot of the same boring stuff it is now. Sure there will be tougher and more interesting content but there is still a lot of meaningless requirements you will have to do.

Also if you really feel this way you need to discard the notion that school is for learning useful information. Especially at the high school level it is about learning how to learn. And that includes actual proper work ethic.

Don't get me wrong. No one is saying you have to put 24/7 into your schoolwork to get good grades. Sure the valedictorian will probably be someone that did but that doesn't matter. A lot of top universities are looking for more ""rounded"" students anyways. But there is a huge gap between going all out and putting in no work at all. Heck just do the minimum. Putting no work into your education means no one will put work into you and help you succeed. You think having good ap scores and such gets you into a good school by itself? Not without good recommendations. 

There's still time to change. If you think that getting into a good university is a worthwhile endeavor you need to get your act in gear. You don't have to give 100% but you have to give something.

"Several points:

- Part of the talent of rap is the cleverness of the lyrics.  Given all the time in the world, I couldn't come up with the lyrics that Eminem can.  If your opinion of rap is based on a handful of low-effort people, then sure, but then I should be able to judge ""singers"" on Nicki Minaj and Ke$ha.

- Nearly anything can be mastered if you have the time to devote to it.  That's what those awards are celebrating.  The people who DID put in the time.  The Grammys are not reserved for people with born talent.  They're for people who've made a contribution to the craft.  The people being awarded have done that, regardless of how they got where they are.  

&gt; Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping.

- And yet they don't.  Every person on this planet that has fingers is capable of being a piano prodigy, but most don't do it.  So we recognize the people who put the time into becoming great at it.","There's a lot of assertions here that are just completely incorrect, so I'm gonna break down some specific parts, but I think there's a big flaw in almost all of your logic:

**Just because it is easier to start rapping doesn't mean being a good rapper takes any less skill.** I think a lot of your viewpoints are biased in the sense that rapping may be easier to pick up just because it is unlike singing or playing an instrument in that relatively mediocre rappers are not unlistenable in the same way that bad singers are. Yes, there are some bad rappers in the mainstream. There are also bad songs in [plenty of other genres,](http://time.com/3613505/top-10-worst-songs) but it makes no sense invalidating the entire genre because of it.

&gt;Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat.

This seems to be pretty much your entire argument, essentially.

Most good rappers put in effort to how they say the words to make it compliment the beat and convey a message. I'm gonna be cliche and user Kendrick Lamar for most of my examples, just because he's one of the most vocally diverse rappers.

[In this song, he elongates his words and uses a raspy voice to make it sound like he's wailing, since it's a heart-wrenching part of the album](https://youtu.be/e5Ri76UodWM?t=2m23s)

[In this song, he changes his pitch to sound more like an adolescent](https://youtu.be/10yrPDf92hY?t=24s)

Those were some extreme examples, but there's also more subtle ones that are still very important

[In this song, he uses a deeper pitch than usually to give off braggadccio/cocky vibes, since he's meant to be freestyling in the car with his friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckbxdHZTlI)

[In contrast, this song uses a more relaxed tone since he's 'made it' at this point in the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF8aaTu2kg0)

All of this are important changes to his voice that are difficult to do in the first place, and even harder to do while simultaneously staying on beat and not sounding too forced.

&gt;Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever

Then that individual would be a bad rapper. A lot of other genres have untalented artists, too.

&gt;I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then.

No, because poetry doesn't have a musical element. Almost any song is poetic if you just look at the lyrics, but there are other musical considerations that change how a rap song sounds.

That said, when spoken word poets put an effort into making it have musical aspects, there is precedence for Grammies, as there should be.

"I'd say you're taking a very superficial view of the cold war. In many ways this was a mutually beneficial system, where the US &amp; USSR divided up the world (2/3 vs. 1/3) into their own hegemonic spheres of influence. Then for the duration of the cold war, each one was able to use the ostensible 'threat' of the other as a propaganda tool to maintain their own local/regional control.

Now certainly we can see that over the course of many decades, some people in power were closer in degree to 'true believers' who took this geopolitical game too seriously, to the point of real danger. But generally speaking, it's not really accurate to think that the cold war was considered a bad outcome from the US's strategic perspective. The perpetual war on terror is the new version of this: a supposedly existential threat that gives a politically expedient excuse for all kinds of measures of control.","This is an interesting point of view, and I think it does have some merit. However, to apply your reasoning even further back, it's like saying that Germany actually won World War I because the conclusion of World War I led to the Treaty of Versailles, which through a long change of events, led to Nazi Germany, which started World War II, which, following the reasoning of your OP, ultimately led to Germany coming out ahead of the US in 2015.

"you are inconsistently and ambiguously defining your concerns, and false attributing consequences to technology without offering any data to support your claims.

Reason 1: Laziness

why is jotting a note down on paper less lazy than adding it to a cloud-based shopping list through a voice interface? have you actually used the two side by side? using paper is frequently the fastest method there. using echo, not only do you have to wait for the device to confirm whether it actually performed the action, you have to take out a phone, unlock it, launch an app, and wait for a load before you can even use your shopping list. paper is instantaneous, and you could argue that it's the laziest option. 'it feels lazier' is not a valid conclusion supported by data.

Reason 2: Reliance on Technology

you are already completely, utterly, and irreversibly reliant on technology. others have made this point but i want to stress the absolute and total reality of it to you. every single item around you is human technology. building a fire is technology. you will die very quickly if you stopped using technology. you failed to demonstrate why reliance on technology is bad in general, and why reliance on echo is bad specifically. 

you say
&gt;'clearly there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together' 

but you do not elaborate on what these issues are, or provide evidence that these issues actually exist. you could argue that a family car, a refrigerator, or even the house itself keeps a household together. these are all technology. by your argument, these would all be problematic for some mysterious and unstated reason. 

your other example: 
&gt;'shop by shouting a phrase at a robot, no need to go out' 

this is equally presumptuous and ill-defined. firstly, you haven't actually stated why 'not going out' is a bad thing. maybe it lets me have more time to relax at home instead of standing in line at the market, which is definitely a positive outcome for me. secondly, you assume that not shopping equals not going out, which is plainly not true. maybe with the time that i save by not going to the store, i go out and do something else instead, like see a movie, hang out with friends, or go hiking. here, your argument is based on unfounded assumptions and cannot support your claim. 

when you say 'reliance on technology' what you seem to really mean is that 'we are too reliant on some particular technologies like smartphones and the internet, but it's ok to be reliant on other technologies like electricity and modern food production.' you have picked some arbitrary limit on technological advancement, for example 2006 (just before smartphones) or 1985 (just before popular consumer internet) and have decided that that's the right amount of technology to be reliant on. however, you still haven't provided any convincing arguments as to why that particular level of technology is the right one. 

&gt; In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way?

indeed, why? you're claiming that making things slower and more difficult would be better. it's your job to answer this question. 

Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy

yes, this may be a legitimate concern generally. however, it is true of many technologies aside from echo. you have not argued sufficiently that echo is worse in this regard, or provided any actual evidence that privacy has been invaded. the potential for harm to occur is not the same as harm actually occurring. if we banned technology based on the potential for harm, we'd have to ban basically everything: kitchen knives, leather belts, baseball bats, you get the idea.

in summation, i have shown that your position on this issue is flawed in specific and demonstrable ways. you cannot make the claim you're making without updating or revising your position, and therefore must change your view. ","I'm going to break down each point separately.

1) Amazon Echo creates laziness - So your examples are someone dictating instead of writing, listening to news instead of reading, and asking about weather instead of just looking outside. 

Dictating has been around for quite almost ever. Just because the person isn't writing it down doesn't make them lazy. If we are making assumptions, you can assume that maybe they are becoming more organized and efficient with their time.

As for listening to the news, you could say it's exactly like watching the news on TV or on the Internet. Or it's like listening to the radio. Listening instead of reading is not laziness. It may even make news slightly more accessible which would inform more people (the argument of informing them correctly or incorrectly is a different subject for a different day).

As for weather, I love the weather and just by looking outside I could not tell you what the weather will be like. I still need technology to give me a close educated guess based on stats and history to tell me how hot it's going to be or if there will be a late afternoon shower or if it's going to snow so much that I should probably stay home.

This idea that accessing information by voice is not laziness. It is just another method of educating ourselves in whatever we want to know.

2) Amazon Echo creates a reliance on technology - I think you slightly used the ""The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning."" out of context. First of all, they use it as a tool, much like a cell phone helps keep the household functioning, much like refrigerators help, much like a car helps. These tools do certain things that help make our lives easier so we can spend more time doing whatever we want, or as the ad depicts, spend more time with the family. Secondly, the Echo is not depicted doing anything that current technologies can't already do.

As for shopping, what is the harm in ordering toilet paper by asking your Echo to do so? While yes, some people may go out less because of this, they probably already weren't going out because you can order everything online, without the Echo. And, as the ad shows, this feature (along with others) can be extremely helpful for those with disabilities.

3) Amazon Echo is an Invasion of Privacy - This is a running theme with the Internet of Things. Any piece of technology that can connect to the internet can be used to collect your information and sell it to whoever wants it. The Echo is not the only thing that does this.

Now for it always listening. Sure, slightly terrifying, but it would take a lot of work Amazon to parse through audio from 24/7/365 just to find out what you like and don't like. They will probably keep track of your commands, but they (and most websites, companies, apps, etc.) already do. And for the most part, the big companies use this information to make your experiences with them better. Yes, nefarious things may happen, but companies take big risks by doing so. Just look at [Lenovo and the Superfish fiasco](http://www.cnet.com/news/lenovo-hit-by-lawsuit-over-superfish-adware/#!) and [Samsung with their always listening TVs](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/02/09/385001258/samsungs-privacy-policy-warns-customers-their-smart-tvs-are-listening).

In summary, this device is not harmful because it makes information more accesible (which does not create laziness), it does things that current technology already does, and it is no more of a spy on your life, than your phone or computer already is. In fact, as the video shows, it can make life easier for those with disabilities.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more structured and detailed argument, breaking down each of the OP's concerns and providing counterarguments with logical reasoning.

"The NFL schedule is good because it's so short.  With only 16 games on predictable days, each game has an urgency to it.  It's not quite playoff level, sure, but the difference of 1-2 games can mean an invitation to the playoffs or not... so the teams do bring their best every single game.  There's a lot of parity in the league, so you don't see too many atrocious teams or bad games. 

The MLB schedule is good because it's so long.  The times are predictable and games are cheap &amp; accessible (outside Boston &amp; NY, anyways).  They're not *exciting*, particularly on TV IMO... but they're fun in person, and nice to have on in the background on a lazy summer day.

There's no problem with either of those - they're great fun.

"There are a few problems with this, but I'll address what I believe to be the main problem with the idea.

You suggested this be done every 100 years or so. There's nothing inherently wrong with that amount of time, but rather having a set date in general.

Think about if, in today's political climate, everyone knew that in, say, 15 years the Constitution would have to be redone. Most politics for the next 15 years would be totally centered around each political party trying to gain the upper hand for the next rewrite. It would be similar to a lame duck president, except it would have far more detrimental effects to the overall political process.

The Constitution was designed to allow for amendments when we as a nation see that something needs to be changed or updated. And the Supreme Court exists to interpret the Constitution and its amendments. Adding this countdown timer to its revision would distract from the day-to-day policy making that is, in reality, more important to our government.","The Constitution is updated through amendments and case law. It would be a waste of tax payers money to go through the process you are describing. If it aint broke, don't fix it. I worked at the State Bar of California and can tell you that California has been trying to rewrite its Rules of Professional Conduct for 15 years. And they will never finish. It is a fruitless endeavor.

With that said, any time an ambiguity in the law comes up, usually through a landmark case that rises up through the judicial system into the Supreme Court, our Supreme Court justices make a ruling on it. Now, whenever that situation arises again, we can determine the right course of action.

Any time societal views change, like slavery or gay marriage, Congress passes amendments to the Constitution. An amendment is literally an update to a document, which is exactly what you are asking for.

There is nothing that is not current. No one is reading the Constitution and having trouble figuring out if slavery is still legal. It seems like you are suggesting that all layman have some sort of rule book for dummies that simplifies all of today's laws. Not gonna happen. There is way too much gray area for a simple rewording to cover. It is all decided by case law. That is what the justice system is for.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a clear and logical argument against the idea of setting a specific date for rewriting the Constitution. It highlights how such a process could lead to political turmoil and distract from the day-to-day governance of the country. It also emphasizes the existing mechanisms, such as amendments and the Supreme Court, that allow for necessary changes to be made to the Constitution without the need for a complete rewrite.",0
"&gt; Their is no relative degree of suffering, everyone has a hard life, and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better.

Everyone has their own individual struggles, but there are some struggles that encompass entire swaths of individuals. Racism, sexism, and other types of discrimination distill people down to one trait – race, gender, etc. Reducing the negative language surrounding the dehumanization of these groups of people does indeed make life better for the people in that minority group.

There's a thought experiment called the [Petrie Multiplier](http://blog.ian.gent/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html), originally used to demonstrate the effect that sexism has on the female vs male experience in the tech industry:

&gt; Let's say that we have 20% women and 80% men in Tech.  And that 20% of people make inappropriate remarks or other sexist moves towards people of the opposite gender.  So 20% of men make sexist remarks to women, and 20% of women make sexist remarks to men.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's start with 50 people.  [...]  Given the 20% ratios, we have 40 men and 10 women, and 8 of the 40 men sometimes make sexist remarks towards women, while 2 of the 10 women make sexist remarks to men. I can't emphasise enough that there is no difference in sexism between the genders.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's see what happens when we have had 70 sexist remarks made.
&gt; 
&gt; The luckiest man receives zero sexist remarks.  But in fact he doesn't need to be very lucky, because most men receive no remarks.  There is an unlucky guy [...] who receives three sexist remarks, [...] But that's the unluckiest guy out of 40.  
&gt; 
&gt; The luckiest woman receives four sexist remarks.  So let's get this straight: the luckiest woman out of 10 experiences worse sexism than the unluckiest man out of 40. 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course it gets worse. The unluckiest woman experiences nine incidents.  On average? The mean number of sexist remarks per man is 0.35, while for women it is 5.6.  There's a gender disparity of 4:1 but the disparity in experience is 16:1.
&gt; 
&gt; Men are no more sexist than women in this thought experiment, but women's experience is sixteen times worse than the men's.
&gt; 
&gt; The maths that explains this is simple. With 20% women the gender ratio is 1:4.  So there are 4 times as many men to make sexist remarks, so 4 times as many sexist remarks are made to women as to men. But there are 4 times fewer women to receive sexist remarks, so each individual woman is four times as likely to receive a given remark than an individual man is.  These effects multiply, so in this example the mean number of sexist remarks per woman is 16 times the number per man.  This holds in general, so with a gender ratio of 1:r, women will receive r2 times as many sexist remarks as men.
&gt; 
&gt; That is the Petrie Multiplier. An argument that an attack on sexism in Tech is NOT an attack on men.

We can see that, in terms of suffering of sexist remarks, women in this situation suffer more. Sure, the men in the thought experiment probably suffer in other aspects of their life, but it doesn't impact the fact that reducing sexist remarks overall will lead to a significant impact in the reduction of suffering in this situation.

We can apply the same reasoning to any other minority group on the receiving end of hurtful remarks. Being politically correct is not an attack on the people making the jokes or the off-hand remarks – instead, it's a move to reduce the suffering of those affected by the remarks. And even when you entertain the idea that there's no relative degree of suffering, which I interpret as ""everyone suffers equally"" in some weird universal karmic balance system, it would mean that everyone suffers from some type of hurtful off-hand remark. In that case, reducing those remarks would reduce suffering for everyone.","I think political correctness is a bit out of hand, I'm a minority (disabled) so I'll relate some of the points I favour and don't in relation to what you say; (I'm profoundly deaf btw).

Firstly, there are some things that absolutely shouldn't be said, they're outdated terms that are particularly offensive. For example, they used to go around calling deaf people (or deaf-mutes) 'deaf and dumb', say that to me or any other deaf person and you're liable to provoke a very aggressive respond.

However, I notice a lot of politically correct 'terms' are championed, somewhat ironically, by the 'majority' who simply don't understand the impact of what that term has. For example, deaf people have their own culture, mostly due to the communication barrier, they identify as 'deaf', they don't identify as the hearing like to put it as 'hearing impaired'. In fact, that term pisses me and plenty of others in the community off, we're not 'impaired', we're deaf, end off.

The problem is though, is those who do champion a cause tend to be very blind to the wider picture, instead focusing on narrow goals, perhaps supported by evidence that supports their views and not necessarily evidence of the views of the full community.

What I'm trying to say is, there has to be a balance between avoiding terms that are out and out offensive for a particular group, to going so far the other way you're not really representing them anymore. A lot of political correctness has gone too far in one direction, on top of that, the movement for 'equality' often focuses on singular aspects, so say female rights, or ethnic representation, but only ever skim the surface of the issue; See, token black guy representation in movies and whatnot, it is skin deep, satisfies some equality tick but doesn't really represent a particular culture or group or individual from a group. 

That's why I shake my head a lot at politically inspired (or otherwise) equality activism, because a lot of the times it isn't all-encompassing, people jostle for gender-equality, sexuality-equality and whatnot but ignore things like disability-equality, and then you get things just making the minority net 'wider' by adding things like diabetes as an equality 'right'.

Basically, I think people need to stop for a minute and do things the 'deaf' way in some respects; That is, celebrate our differences, there's not always a need to be the same, there's not always a need to 'check your privilege'. Those who buy-in to differences, accept them and celebrate them while being inclusive are the ideal people, but they're a rarity as a lot of issues just drop into a slanging match.

An example; A co-worker of mine was always inclusive towards deaf people, but we thought we'd show him what the reality was, we took him to a deaf club (no speech, sign language only) and he said it was eye-opening how difficult it was for him to access the community, because essentially it was role reversal. He took up learning the language to get involved, and the deaf group tried their best via writing/talking in the mean time. Obviously we can't do that for things like gender or sexuality in the same way, but I do think there are methods to get involved that will open up eyes to certain aspects that would promote camaraderie and friendlieness without political correctness interfering; god knows the PC brigade would have had a field day if they caught one black guy who used to do the 'smile and you can see me' joke at work, especially if any white person mentioned it outside of work, that's wrong imo, because it's all done in the spirit of people bonding and having fun and recognising that yeah, we're different, is that such a bad thing?

NB: Just in case; I don't condone racism, sexism or any kind of discrimination, it exists, sure, and it's fucking hurtful when it happens - I should know, but inclusiveness is the answer not PC or the latest fad 'trend' from social campaigners.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a clear and logical argument supported by a specific thought experiment that demonstrates the impact of reducing hurtful remarks on minority groups. The Petrie Multiplier thought experiment effectively shows how even if everyone has struggles, certain groups can face significantly more suffering due to discrimination. This evidence-based approach is likely to be more persuasive in changing the OP's view.",0
"While I'm sure this is true sometimes, some people just have different values than you. That doesn't necessarily indicate any insecurity or damage.

Plenty of people just think sex is a fun activity that really has no moral or even any great emotional component to it. For people like this, having sex with everyone they pick up at a bar is no more or less a simple fun activity than going to the bar in the first place. 

Such people, and I have met them, simply don't place any particular weight, in terms of their self worth or otherwise, on sex. It's just a hobby, like playing soccer. 

That would be a difference of opinion, not an indication of insecurity. ","Your opinion doesn't seem to actually be based on anything. You say you feel like there must be something deeply broken about someone who is okay with it, only because you wouldn't be okay with it.

Some people just see sex as a fun thing to do. They enjoy experiencing it with different people and don't necessarily need for it to be or feel like something more than that. 

It is perfectly fine that you would not be comfortable with it, and there are obviously people who do this that have deep seeded emotional problems, just as there are people who don't have any sex that have deep seeded emotional problems, but having a lot of random sex doesn't necessarily say anything about the person.

"The best way to convince you is to show you the abuses that have happened.

The government is not a monolith: it is composed of ordinary people, people that are susceptible to corruption.

The above link includes law-abiding and non-hate groups: vietnam protesters, Native Americans, civil rights movements, and socialists. Is it so distant to say a program like this could be used to target people that oppose the president's agenda, like rival politicians? ","Let me start by saying, I understand where you're coming from, and yes you bring some valid points. Why would any law-abiding citizen need to worry about government monitoring of the internet? I've heard some people compare it to the police, and that it is in our best interest.

but there some major problems:

For me personally, it worries me that by allowing the government to observe anyone's personal lives, at any time puts a lot of power into government hands, and opens even more doors for corruption and abuse of power. As it stands, there is no one in to hold the government accountable. We have no clue how broad the spying is or how much of it happens. Who is there to say, ""hey, that's not right"" or ""hey you're not really working for the better of the people""? No one really. That's a scary thought to me. When the American people trade liberty for security, they have to put more and more faith in a government that has time after time proved itself to be unreliable. Politics are just like anything else in this world: there are good ones and bad ones. 

The other main issue is that it's not really working out too well. The FBI has admitted that they have not foiled any terrorist threats from spying on US citizens.

The main point I'm trying to get at is that if we don't oppose this, then we are giving the US government a HUGE amount of power and pretty much giving it no limits to that power. Which is against everything America stands for (Limits and balances to power).

"It's worth mentioning that both USA and Russia were taken by force through an era of imperialism.  You are suggesting that countries opt in.  This method - while more civil and required by our modern day, global society - is unlikely to bear fruit.

&gt;  The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. 

**Language**: [Europe has many languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe).  This is an especially large problem when dealing with the law where interpretation of a given case, statement or law is the difference between success and failure.  So if only for the most basic reasons, if you have one country, you need one language to be the primary one.  Which one would it be?  

**Social programs**: Any standard that any country currently set for their social programs is a carefully calibrated balance between what they're willing to spend and who they will spend it on. This means that once the countries are united, *everyone* needs to eliminate their social programs and start over with a much larger country in mind.  This will be *fantastic* for the poor countries that have little to no social safety net.  But this will mean that the bar will be significantly lowered for more lucrative countries.  

**Political Parties**: Each country has it's own political preference.  But more than that, the political systems are not even set up to mean the same things.  So to me, the French Socialist party might seem a lot like the Swedish Social Democrats, but they might be vastly different.  Or the current prime minister of Finland is of the National Coalition Party	, but outside of Finland, it doesn't really exist.  The point that I'm making is that there is no way for anyone to feel represented in government if they will almost certainly have to give up the type of leadership that they voted for and want.

I could go on, but the picture looks the same across the board.  Any country with something to lose wouldn't want to lose it.  Instead, a separate union similar to the European Union makes sense.  EU has their standards for grouping countries and after the third bailout with Greece, it's unlikely that they will be changing their minds.  So, a separate union for smaller countries would be an incredible point of financial leverage.  Other than that, I find it hard to see how or why any larger country would want to give up what they have.  ","how many primary languages are there in the USA? i would say somewhere in the estimate of.... 1.

you can't do the same for Europe where everything is completely different - money/currency, religions, general lifestyle.

"In a vacuum, getting rid of CoonTown is undeniably a good thing.

"I eat meat and care very much for morality. I was a vegetarian for many years for the usual reasons: not approving of the horrible ways the animals are often treated in industrial meat production, wanting to avoid the environmental impact of industrial farming, etc.

Although there were other factors involved as well, I started eating meat again because I accepted that:

1) By choosing to eat meat that is hunted by myself or someone I know, raised by someone I know, or raised free-range on grass from a company I trust, I take ownership of how the animal is being treated and help create a market for ethically-raised meat.

2) Many of the protein alternatives that vegetarians consume are actually as destructive to the environment as ethically-raised meat or worse. Soy production, for example, is extremely problematic.

So, yes, I care very much, but came to the conclusion that becoming a total vegetarian was not necessary within my morals.","While I agree that a lot of people opinions towards eating meat is basically 1. i was raised eating mean 2. meat is delicious 3. i dont care much for animals 4. there are plenty of people who don't care therefore i eat meat. i personally had thought about it and i could not find a way to justify not eating meat.

killing animals can not be immoral, because morality is a manifestation of a system of behaviour which maximises a persons chance of survival and reproduction. a person does not steal because doing so will piss other people off and make enemies. the same is true of killing. and because humans are social animals, it is very important to not piss other people off because the long term benefits of cooperation with others greatly outweigh the short-term gain. so one can not extend said morality system to animals, because man does not need to not kill animals in order to use animals, and because animals can not reciprocate whatever moral system that a human might subscribe to. an animal does not have an idea of ownership, pets will steal food from your plates, and animals will kill and eat you in the wild.

There are two answers here: The justice system is failing Batman and Gotham, as they should be executing the repeat offenders rather than sentencing them to Arkham Asylum.

The chief claim is that men are better than women at sports, and we want to watch the best teams. While it's true that men's teams outperform women's teams, it's ridiculous to say that we only want to watch the best teams. Some fans choose college games over professional because they're more exciting. Fans of the Mets fall in love with their team despite their obvious inferiority to the Yankees.

"I would support this idea, with one tweak: in order to ensure that the transaction is net positive for the student, investors do not buy shares in the student's gross income, but rather in however much income they earn above the income they would expect without a degree, and would have a lifetime cap on how much they would collect.

Are you planning on making traditional student loans *illegal* in order to get to this state?

"Suffering isn't the default, doing stuff is. 

Millions of years ago, we did shit to survive. We hunted wooly mammoths and looked for berries and stuff. 

As time went on we discovered farming and we settled down, so we didn't need to do as much so we had more free time but we still had needs like shelter and friendship so we kept doing shit. 

Fast forward to 2015, we still need to do shit but not as much. Exercise is an option not a fact of life. We don't need to look for berries we got Safeway, we don't need to kill a pig found in the wild, we just buy pork. We don't need to build a home we just rent it. We don't even need to go to a friends house or hear their voice to talk , we got texting, Facebook ect. 

My point is that it is not the default to be bored, we have just been spoiled as a species. ","I'll address each of your points.

&gt; #1 Boredom is the default mood. Mere existence isn't enough to satisfy us, we constantly have to distract ourselves from boredom.

I disagree. Humans are pack animals. If you are with your ""clan"" (friends, family, etc), you should not be bored. Most humans find enjoyment simply from being around people they like. If you do not, then you are in the minority. If you are alone, then you will feel boredom. This is because humans are not meant to be secluded.

&gt; #2 Pleasure requires effort, suffering does not. I literally don't have to do anything to suffer from boredom and starvation.

I disagree as well. For me, pleasure comes easily. I will talk to a stranger and get pleasure, listen to a song and get pleasure, eat a nice meal and get pleasure. There isn't much effort I'm putting in. When I'm not putting in effort, I don't feel suffering. If you have a good 2-3 hours of pleasure, 1-2 hours of alone-time shouldn't make you fail pain. Food is also easy to come by nowadays and is in abundance. That's not an issue, so it's worthless to discuss.

&gt; #3 Suffering is more powerful feeling than pleasure. Is there an opposite to a cluster headache

In my opinion, you underrate pleasure. If your mother dies, you feel immense suffering. That's not because the value of human life weighs so much on your soul that you can't bare to see a person die. It's because of the all the pleasure that person brought you. You feel pain, because you miss the pleasure.

It's the same thing with a cluster headache. You underrate the good feeling of having a clear head and feeling ""normal"". Cluster headaches hurt so much because normal feelings are so good. With normal feelings in your head, you can come up with amazing ideas, formulas, etc that make you feel immense joy. You take that for granted.

&gt; #4 The universe doesn't care about how we feel. No one is protecting us. If I'm falling onto spikes, universe is not gonna pull me away and protect me, no matter how hard I pray.

The universe is not some sentient being with feelings. Saying that the universe doesn't care about you falling onto spikes is the same as saying the playground didn't care that you broke your arm while on the slide. The universe doesn't have feelings. Dying is a part of life. It is the equal to birth. Birth is the best thing that can happen to you and death is the worst. Sure, you could wish you were never alive to have never felt suffering, but at the same time, you would never have felt joy.

"&gt;Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that.

Thinking about IP violations as theft (defined as depriving someone of their rightfully owned property) is, in my mind, a wrong way to go about it. Ownership of something doesn't just mean you have possession of it, but that you have the right to *control its use.* We talk about violations of IP as ""theft"" when in reality, it is closer to a violation of the right to control the property. 

So if a person has a patent on a widget, he has the right to license and control the use of that widget. If he doesn't think it should be used in, say, weapons manufacturing- he has the right to deny the use of his IP in that field. 

Now say that a weapons company ignores this and uses the widget anyway. He has been wronged in two senses: first by loss of profits from the use of his widget (wherein the thing stolen is the *profit*, not the widget itself). Second, in the *control of the use* of the widget. The weapons manufacturer didn't deprive the inventor of *possession,* but he did deprive the inventor of *control.* 

So while it may not be theft of the property (on your definition of theft), it *is still a violation of property rights.*

Edit- To the economic utility point: I'm not sure I get your point. The argument in favor of IP is that IP will not be developed without protection for use and profit. This seems clearly correct: say a corporation could steal any patent from any inventor and deprive the inventor of profit or control without fear of reprimand. What incentive would the inventor have to devote time to inventing? What incentive would any person have to do research, when they would not be able to profit from the research.

&gt;What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated.

"This thread could use some numbers.  Here's the share of GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity by country.

I grew up in a similar situation to the one you described, with an alcoholic, physically and verbally abusive father between the ages of 10 and 18. It wasn't until I got a little bigger around 16 that I started hitting back, eventually leading to more serious physical altercations between him and I when I was 18, with our last big fight being the last time I've spoken to him (I'm 26 now).

That said, there are two things in particular I took from that experience which I believe are contrary to ""this should be customary"";

1. Hitting the man back back didn't make him any less likely to pick fights with me as the years went on, i.e., it did nothing to reduce the level of abuse going on at the time.

2. At the time, being able to hurt him the way he had hurt me over the years *did* bring a (very short-lived) sense of satisfaction, this feeling that he was ""getting what he deserved"". However, that satisfaction never translated into long-term resiliency against the *psychological* effects of his abuse; eight years later, I'm still dealing with avoidant personality disorder and other PTSD-related issues directly related to it. While hitting him back may have helped reduce the number of hits I took during any given altercation, it did nothing to ""defend"" against the long-term psychological repercussions of his actions.

While I agree that defending oneself from a physical aggressor, be they muggers or their own parents, should not be looked down upon (and believe you'd be hard-pressed finding someone who disagrees), based on my own experience with a physically abusive parent, fighting your parents shouldn't be seen as a customary way of avoiding future emotional/psychological distress from said abuse.

"I don't think the dropping fertility in the industrialized world is due to this ""hyper rationality"", because this ""hyper rationality"" doesn't seem to be manifesting in other domains.

For example, are humans even remotely rational when it comes to voting?

Or heck, just vote for whoever is tall and has a convincing smile, a nice suit, and a slogan with a couple feel-good words.

Or how is watching dreck on TV ""hyper-rational""? Or spending money on an impressive car or handbag, or doing drugs, or arguing with people on the internet, etc.?

To get back to the birth example, I think it can be explained perfectly well witjout ""hyper rationality"" - people respond to incentives, and the incentive in the modern world (especially in a city) are very different from those of most of our more fertile ancestors. Put in our shoes, they would probably also choose to have less kids, for the same reasons we do: contraception is available; living space is very expensive; education is expensive; women work; there are many more other things on which one is tempted to spend money; hardly anybody has a job at which kids can be of any help, etc.","There is a different between someone's proposed reasons for doing something and their actual reasons for doing something. A person who doesn't want to have a child might justify their decision with all the things you mentioned, but due to social pressure might fail to mention that they dislike children and that's why they're choosing not to have them. The other considerations like finances are just a plus.

I also suggest r/childfree for a celebration of people who are following their instincts by NOT having children. They are bucking a strong societal pressure to live their lives like they actually want to. Is this due to an increasingly rational society? Possibly. But they are not fighting their animal nature.

There is still a strong social pressure to procreate even if your circumstances make it an irrational choice, and you'll find examples of that on the subreddit. To say that higher education and industrialization (your rationality proxy) results in a lower birthrate because people are making a rational decision to not have children despite their desire to doesn't make much sense in light of Sweden.

Rationality doesn't seem to be causing people to completely dismiss their emotional desire to have children in most cases.

The government should therefore mirror all its peoples' interests. The group for chronically ill does exist, so is it not fair that they at least receive some recognition in government? If people have an interest in having government-subsidized chronic disease healthcare then the government should at least somewhat represent those people.

When one observes the art and literature left behind from the Black Death, one can see that the people were suffering. Grotesque images of the infected as well as hysteria over what caused the disease ran rampant. The misery of the general public could not be understated, as a force outside their control killed their loved ones without discretion. If such a kind of suffering was to happen, and people knew exactly who was to blame, is it not reasonable to conclude that deaths of chronically ill which affected people would cause the affected to conduct civil unrest?

The argument that GDP will increase is somewhat flawed by itself. The government has actually produced something known as a stimulus check to boost consumer spending in times of recession. Taxdollars which go through the government would still increase the country's GDP because the government still spends money on subsidizing chronic medication. If the proposed system of removing government funding was introduced, then that same money would instead go directly to charities and thereby go to health expenditure. The GDP would remain the same because the government no longer is allowed to tax for chronic illness in the proposed system. The government would still keep the same amount of usable revenue because of an equal decrease in expenditures and an equal decrease in revenue.

In addition to this, chronic illness can range from ~~mile~~ mild to immediate death upon removal of medication. Those people who have chronic asthma aren't really burdening society, but their malady can still be classified as chronic. How does one draw the line between that and something more severe, like crohn's disease? Some people who would otherwise be happily be living would be killed in the name of euthanization. If the government was to apply this same principle to other minority groups, the government might as well kill all seniors over 80 years of age. Obviously, they were suffering from old age, right? 80 years is definitely the right cutoff age and is definitely not an arbitrarily drawn number, right?",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a personal anecdote that directly relates to the topic at hand, chronic illness. By sharing their own experience with a chronic illness and how medical advancements helped them live a better life, Response 2 appeals to the emotional side of the argument.

"So, I'm blatantly stealing a bunch of this from [this article](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/) so if you want to see it written much better than I can, read that. But here is the thing: It isn't limited to women, and it's much more broad than you think. Humans are all creatures with skills and needs. In order to create bonds with other humans, you need a skill that fits with that human's needs.

This can be something as simple as a mutual need for companionship, or as complex as a company's desire to pay money for someone to do upkeep on their servers that run on a very specific set of software that you happen to know how to use.

The thing about women isn't that they all have this list of things to be attracted to. A woman being attracted to you is not (necessarily) about how much you earn or how handsome you are. It's about how interested you can make her with your unique attributes.

As an exercise: what makes you special? If I were a girl, interviewing you for the job of boyfriend, what would make you stand out, and what would you say makes you a better applicant?

Now, a harder exercise: What do you do that shows that externally? It's a pretty good bet that most people can't read your mind, so if you want the world to know that (for instance) you're cool and confident, or that you are a world-class singer, or that you are exceptionally nice (not the general ""nice"" that means bland, but that you care about humanitarian causes and do something to fix them), then the onus is on you to show that outwardly.

As an anecdote, here are some things that I have done that have led to some form of romantic or sexual involvement:

* Told jokes

* Juggled

* Played guitar (badly)

* Taught someone how to play a non-""conventional"" board game (Arkham Horror, in case you cared)

* Had the confidence to ask if they would go out with me (this should really be near the top of the list), and then didn't freak out if the answer was no (I've actually experienced this: one girl accepted after I didn't make a big deal of a ""no"").

* Recited the quadratic equation from memory.

I'm sure I can think of others, but the point remains that all of that had not much to do with my ability to provide for them or how handsome I was (and I'm a fat nerd, so I'm not really traditionally good-looking). ","I'm sure many people will answer with smarter and more interesting arguments, but this thought might be a good thing to keep in mind whenever you get your ""rush of negative thoughts from my past experiences"":

In most of the world and especially during most of History, most people weren't rich, didn't have the resources to take care of a family in the long run, weren't seen as attractive, weren't educated or privileged and didn't have an appealing job. Hell, until the 19th century the vast majority of the world's population worked in agriculture without any benefits from technology or hope for growth. 

All of the things on your list are taken for granted today, but are completely unreachable for poorer and less privileged populations (= most people who have ever lived) throughout the world and History. 

And yet people still fall in love and get married.

So there must be something more to sex, love and marriage than what you used to think right? Otherwise underprivileged people getting married wouldn't make any sense.

"I think you're overestimating the power of the President to harm those businesses.

First, the President does not have dictatorial control over the government.  The scope of what a President can do without the assistance of Congress is a great deal more limited than you'd imagine.  Especially when Congress may be openly hostile to the President's agenda, and pass laws via veto override that stop the President.

Second, the President's power to effectuate his agenda can be more limited than you realize, even if he has the lawful authority to do so.  For instance, Obama has had a very hard time getting immigration and customs officers to go along with executive orders around deferred action and low priority cases, because as long as the statute allows the officers discretion, Obama can't micromanage them to make them use the discretion how he wants.  In Sanders' case, he won't be able to change the fact that mid-level investigative staff at the SEC are all angling for industry jobs.

Third, even with the force of the government behind his policies, there are limits on the government's power to regulate.  The 5th Amendment precludes seizure of property, and a number of treaties the US is party to (WTO, Basel, NAFTA) set limits on regulations.  Plus there's the courts general aversion to very skewed schemes.  A 90% federal tax rate combined with California's over 10% state tax rate would mean over a 100% top marginal tax rate overall.  I think there's a good case that federal courts would toss that as being too high, and constituting a 5th amendment taking.","&gt;Bernie Sanders offers a categorically different approach than others,

So did Obama when he campaigned.  He was going to end our wars, close Guantanamo, make the government transparent, move us to clean energy, etc.

"If you require a certain number of hours, you're incentivizing being inefficient and sitting around as long as possible.

Plus, you'd have to set up a huge, costly administration to monitor who did their public service. It would cost way more than just paying people minimum wage to do shit jobs, like we already do.","A person's time has value, so forcing them to use it for public service is forcing people to give up a valuable resource of their own which could be used for various other things that could benefit society.

"of course it couldn't be *morally* justified because **war cannot be morally justified**

People who think so, especially via religion, has their head up their asses. in my opinion

War is never a morale action, it just what we deem a necessary action.

The nuclear bombing was justifiable from the point of view of a country fighting a war. It would have done the most, in terms of the war effort. for the least resources (time, materials, energy, man power, and human lives - on their own country's side)

tl;rl No, in the grand scheme of things, as human beings; no, the bombing was not morally justifiable.
From the point of view of a country fighting another country by means of violence; yes, it was economically justifiable.","&gt; the argument ""but more people would have been killed!"" is not valid as we will never know if more people were saved, but more importantly if we can't tell if more people were saved how would the people at the time know ?

You're right to point out both that at the time of the decision, we didn't know what would happen, and that even know, we have no good way of knowing what would have happened.

But this uncertainty cuts both ways. Harry Truman did not know what would have happened if he didn't act. But if this means dropping the bombs ""can't be justified"", then couldn't you say the same if he hadn't dropped the bombs? If he hadn't gave the order, and even more hundreds of thousands of lives were lost, couldn't you just as easily say that his decision to *not* drop the bombs ""can't be justified"" because he didn't know what would happen?

This is just a fundamental problem of making decisions with limited information. And unfortunately, making those sorts of decisions is literally what the president's job is.

So the questions I would ask when evaluating such an action involve imagining what other people (myself included) would do in his situation. And to really think about that, you have to put yourself in his position. You are responsible for the lives of millions of Americans. There's a war going on right now with people fighting and dying, and you don't know how its going to end. You don't know how many more of your people are going to fight and die and suffer because of your decisions. And now you are given the opportunity to end it all, but not without a cost. You don't know what will happen, but you kind of just have to do the math based on your best assessment of the situation. I don't think it was a decision that was made lightly. We'll never know if it was ""right"", but I think given the situation at the time, it was reasonable. I don't know if that counts as ""being justified"" to you, but its enough for me not to condemn Harry Truman as a mass murderer.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of the difficult decision Truman faced, the uncertainty involved, and the perspective of being in his position.

"Canada has a very different collegiate system to the USA. And we have a very different racial make-up as a result of us not really having had the same numbers of slaves or the same violent opposition towards civil rights. We also don't see quite the same level of disparity between racial groups socio-economically. Our disadvantaged minorities are less disadvantaged than those of the US. 

So our universities don't really implement racial quotas quite the same way as the United States does. 

In Canada the closest thing we have to affirmative choice is universities' treatment of aboriginal students - sometimes qualifying under separate categories and getting additional funding support.

And that's contentious too, but it's not made to punish other people, it's really meant as an effort to help counteract the additional challenges faced by Aboriginal students in obtaining an education. One of the best ways to help aboriginal populations in general is to remove as many barriers to education as possible - people who are empowered and well-employed are great for their community. They're leaders and examples for youth, they're often able funnel money back into their communities for development, they're often better able to service their communities. Setting aside spots for them isn't meant to remove spots for white kids. It's not. Aboriginal students who make it to university often had to attend rougher schools on or near reserves. They're more likely to grow up in foster care. They're less likely to have university-educated parents.

Just imagine that you're a highschool student living with your paternal grandmother - a woman who attended residential school. She didn't receive a great education - she probably left the moment she was able to because residential school was a shitty time for a lot of students and they got schooling that was far below the standards set for other students. When you're raised in an environment where school is a scary, violent, abusive force it doesn't necessarily breed the same academic support.

There are all these barriers that stack up together to make it really hard for them to get into the same programs.

Aboriginal special acceptance programs aren't meant to punish poor or disadvantaged non-aboriginal kids. They're simply meant to help provide clearer avenues for aboriginal students to access education.

I think that's what affirmative action looks to do in the US. 

Affirmative action isn't perfect. You get advantaged kids in any race. But it's one of the best tools we do have for helping poor and depressed groups help themselves. Admitting their kids to universities helps them lift their communities up and that's worth the imperfections in the system. ","I think there is a lot that can be said about subtle ways in which Black and Hispanic students are at a disadvantage in the admissions process, and I agree with other commenters who are making this point, but I actually want to come at this issue from a slightly different direction.   Consider the admissions process not from the perspective of the student, but from the perspective of the college.  The college's job is not to find and admit the ""best"" or ""smartest"" students, whatever that might mean, but rather to admit the students who are going to benefit the college the most.  Most admissions officers, especially at elite private schools in the U.S., will readily admit this if asked.  You can argue that this is somehow ""unfair,"" but remember that the first and most important job of a college is to maximize its own ability to do high-quality education and research.


Admitting a racially diverse student body helps the college achieve this aim in a variety of ways:

1. It helps attract a larger applicant pool.  Some students applying to college value ""diversity"" and will choose to apply to colleges with visible racial minorities preferentially over colleges that are dominated by White students.  Conversely, very few students will cross a college off their list because it is ""too diverse.""  So the college has nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of attracting more applicants if there's more visible diversity.  Colleges would always rather have more applicants than they can admit because then they appear more selective, and thus more prestigious.

2. It keeps alumni and donors happy (who value the perception that the college is ""diverse""), who will then give the college more money which it can spend on things like increasing the quality of its programs or providing more financial aid to needy students.

3. It increases the number of student perspectives on campus, broadening the range of discourse in and out of classes and leading to a higher-quality education as students are exposed to a broader set of ideas and experiences.

4. It gives the college a broader alumni base in communities other than those dominated by Whites and/or Asians.  This helps increase the college's general name recognition and prestige. 


I should note that this approach to the admissions process is typical of private colleges and universities (and a few top-tier public universities) in the U.S.  It is much less true of large state schools and essentially nonexistent outside the U.S.  However, it is these same U.S. private colleges and universities that are most likely to use affirmative action in their decisions, so I think the point stands.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of how affirmative action in Canada is meant to help disadvantaged groups access education, specifically focusing on Aboriginal students. The response also highlights the barriers faced by these students and how affirmative action aims to address them.

I can't think of any organization, company, or scientist who has made those claims. ","The reason GMOs are used is that they are more profitable, and the cost of labels would cut into those profits.

You can't just turn things on and off like a switch. You're forming habits and those habits will be very hard to break.

Don't get me wrong. No one is saying you have to put 24/7 into your schoolwork to get good grades. Sure the valedictorian will probably be someone that did but that doesn't matter. A lot of top universities are looking for more ""rounded"" students anyways. But there is a huge gap between going all out and putting in no work at all. Heck just do the minimum.

The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen.

If there's no official justice system, then there would be nothing to deter people from using violent revenge and angry mob justice when they feel that they have been wronged.  And vigilantes, mobs, and revenge seekers tend to be far more violent and hot-blooded than a dispassionate governmental legal system.

"This is becoming increasingly one part of many facets of the military.  Today, we spend an extraordinary amount of time trying to combat terrorism in its many forms across the world.  Sure, if you're engaging in counterinsurgency strategy, killing people and breaking things so your desired faction gets an advantage is one method you can employ. It's a quick surge (no, not necessarily *that* surge) of military power to tip the scales, giving your preferred ""team"" the advantage.

If you're adopting or transitioning to a counterterrorism strategy, however, this will often involve outreach to the local population and its leaders; providing security; offering resources such as food and clothing, and; generally trying to create conditions that will lower the fear factor of local populations caving to terrorists and heighten the personal investment in building up local communities.

We found this out the hard way during the early stages of Iraq, obliterating the enemy but also obliterating civilians and their homes as well.  Even ignoring humanitarian outcries, this makes it far easier for terrorists to make physical incursions since local populations are vulnerable and scared, and thus more likely to acquiesce to their demands.  It makes it easier for ""emotional"" incursions, because you have a whole generation sympathetic to parties who are going to kill the people and break the things that killed their families and broke their things.

In contrast, we saw way more gains when our military began taking up a police function.  It still had traditional military characteristics, including the realistic ability and legal authority to kill and break things when necessary, but it also adopted a more security/rebuilding role, trying to keep streets safe for people and commerce while providing training, building and resources.

If I wanted to explore the issue further, I'd go so far as to say the best anti-terrorism strategy is going to strongly resemble a nation-building strategy.  It takes time and dedication that most leaders of democratic nations won't be able to muster for the long haul, but that's neither here nor there.  The fact remains that modern military hurdles have expanded beyond showing up on a physical field of battle and trying to outgun the other guys -- which, if we're being honest, is a *vast* oversimplification of historical warfare, and is yet another reason to be skeptical of Huckabee's military acumen.  It's choice phrasing designed to be blunt and appeal to folks who view the military as a cosmetic addition to America's display of strength.  It's not an accurate framing of any military's role, particularly not one like ours that is contributing to such a wide spectrum of international causes, even if we're ultimately there in some form for our (proactive) defense.","Historically, that's what they used to do, sure.

The (legitimate*) purpose of the military is and has always been to defend the public from foreign threats. Now, you're right that the most normal way to do that is to kill people and break things. Killing the damned Nazi that tried to take my house or breaking the tank he's driving is a perfectly reasonable way to protect people from a big foreign threat that manifests in a simple way, often in a uniform or within defined borders.
But those sorts of threats aren't very common any more, are they? Modern threats are a good deal less complicated.

Take Vietnam^. The military tried their standard kill-people-break-stuff routine. In fact, they did it way better than they've ever done it before. How'd that go? Did it mitigate the supposed threat from the NVA? Nup.

And most modern tasks for the defence force are like that. Aside from China, which is deterred by MAD, all of America's threats, from Al Qaeda to African civil war, are unconventional. That means the US military needs to adopt a more sophisticated approach than Mike Huckabee is capable of understanding with his pea brain. This might be something like counter-insurgency, perhaps. These would involve much more than mere violence. EG, in Afghanistan the strategy is clear and build - political science is just as important as violence!

This is why people make fun of Mike Huckabee: he's too stupid or dishonest to be capable of understanding complex things like basic strategy.

"Let's put aside your specific argument and just think about what's more important.

The role of consent in sexual relations isn't just there for its own sake, it's there to reduce harm and trauma in society. Consent is a basic function of an independent, free society where individuals can have autonomy over their own body.

In your first case, the boob staring is a border issue. By entering a public space, you are opening yourself to be looked at by other people. You have a reasonable expectation not to be *leered* at, but still, that's merely an expectation. Just like you have a reasonable expectation not to be called an idiot and challenged on every opinion you have upon first meeting someone, it's merely an expectation. It's part of the shifting social climate of etiquette.

Now, in terms of your consent concept, I think it falls on several faces. First, in terms of a net harm, I think most women/men would agree that someone they barely know telling them they want to masturbate to them would be unsettling. If they were in relationships, it might affect their relationship, and perhaps their SO's relationship with this person. Since the masturbation icon is neither aware, nor directly affected by the act, and being informed of the intention is usually worse than being masturbated to, it follows that they better of the two options would be to not be informed about it.

Finally, it's fundamentally unenforceable. Person A informs Person B they want to masturbate to them. Person B says no, that creeps me out, please don't. What happens next? Only Person A knows if they are honoring the request, and Person B is now given a nasty little reminder about this person every time they interact. Their thoughts might randomly drift to this person, where they then remember the request, and suffer anguish from not knowing if they honored the request or not. Even if they ask Person A, it's not like they can prove they haven't.

So, I get the general idea of your position, I just think it doesn't really apply all that well in practice. ","A few things. Firstly, to assume that you could avoid thinking of a particular person during masturbation, even if you wanted to, is ridiculous. While humans can govern the content of our thoughts to some degree, you do not have the power to govern what you think 100% of the time. Even if you made the effort, often times trying to avoid thinking about something is the surest way to guarantee that you will think about it.

For instance, whatever you do, DO NOT picture a semi-automatic handgun right now! If you are like most people, you have already done so, as the suggestion itself plants the idea and the brain conjures up the image automatically. It doesn't require any effort on your part. There's no way to self-regulate this kind of thing, let alone have others regulate it for you (or even observe the process).

There are two different levels to consider this from. The first is plausibility. Your idea isn't practical, as it isn't something you could guarantee, even if you wanted to.

The second piece is that your suggestion above implies is that other people's thoughts about you are your business. I would argue that they are not. My thoughts about the world are a representation of my inner conditions, not yours, and I will gladly and happily think whatever I like about you and you will likely never know it unless I choose to act on those thoughts via word or deed. Most of our thoughts are really just background noise anyway and our thoughts have varying degrees of consciousness associated with them, so the degree to which you can attribute intent to particular thoughts is highly questionable.

And what of intrusive thoughts? Intrusive thoughts are a phenomena whereby we have unplanned thoughts that are sometimes disturbing in nature that simply materialize and were not planned at all (like being near the edge of a cliff and thinking about jumping).

While regulation of behavior is important, because it directly affects the well being of others livning in society, thought is neither something that you can fully control, nor something that directly affects the agency of another (unless we act upon such thoughts).",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more practical and real-world perspective on the issue at hand.

"You are in that sense correct that in an economy at capacity, government can usually not produce magic growth (unlike an economy in recession, where government can produce growth).

It can however influence the long term trajectory of growth by strengethening long term market confidence, improving public health, education, produdcing a regulatory enviorment which is friendly to innovation, protecting the economy from large volatility (volatility is generally very costly, for various reasons) or by increasing market effiency (externalities, monopolies etc.).
There are situations were government can easily produce massive frowth (in recessions) and even if not in a recession government regulation can influence long term growth (usually only quite slightly and in a long term). There are even more ways for a government to absolutly wreck an economy.
Ofc in a Pluralistic society it is rather hard for an individual to make a huge difference but I'd argue that you are not correct.

Let's take FDR and the New Deal as an example where the Presidency was the main driver behind the Programm, so it is possible for an individual politician to make a signifcant difference in economic performance (especially in time of crisis).","I think that at least in certain contexts, correct govenrment action can absolutely ""grow the economy"".

We've basically just done the experiment; when the 2007-2009 recession hit, the US did stimulus spending, while the EU mostly did austerity.   Most economists (although not all) would have predicted that stimulus spending in a recession would cause the economy to grow while austerity would actually make it shrink more.  And having done the experiment, I think we can say with a fair degree of confidence that they were correct.   

A lot does depend on the exact details, but I think that govenrment policy can have a very significant effect on the economy; and, if handled properly, a very positive one.    

By the way:

&gt;elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates the Federal Reserve Board does that

The President does appointe the next head of the Fed, and to say he has ""no influence"" is often incorrect.  Some presidents have made sure they had a great deal of influence over the Fed.  Nixon, for example, brought the head of the Fed at the time Arthur F. Burns to Camp David as part of his economic summit, and basically browbeat him into going along with his economic policy (with IMHO disastrous results).",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a specific example of how government action can impact the economy by comparing the US stimulus spending during the 2007-2009 recession to the EU's austerity measures. This concrete example, along with the mention of the President's influence over the Federal Reserve, adds credibility and persuasiveness to the argument.",0
"Wow, there is a lot to respond to here.  I'll start out by tackling it point by point.

&gt; There is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty.

First off, sports are actually one of the more genuinely meritocratic institutions in this country.  Although realistically most black people will never become professional athletes, sports in school often come with requirements to maintain a certain GPA, and there are a variety of scholarships that colleges offer for athletes.  This is a minor nitpick, but it's not wrong to suggest sports can help some black people out of poverty.

But that's a minor point.  More importantly, the idea that black people just don't value education is wrong.  Empirically, factually wrong.  [Here is a very interesting article on the subject](http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2013/01/acting_white_theory_black_academic_achievement_based_on_other_factors.html), discussing whether or not black people have a disdain for education and view it as ""acting white.""  What the various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts.  Black students were more likely to report that their friends wanted them to go to college, a majority of all black students personally plan to go to college, and by far the most common reason for not going was being unable to afford it.  Black people were even slightly more likely to consider high-achieving students ""cool"", and a greater proportion of black people said that their friends would be supportive if they received good grades than white people.  To quote the article:

&gt; For more than three decades, researchers have found that black students consistently exhibit more positive attitudes about education than white students, contrary to their lower levels of academic achievement.

This raises the question about why black academic achievement is lower.  One possibility is that schools in black neighborhoods have much less funding and larger class sizes that make individualized attention difficult.  Another could be a feeling of being unsafe, which, the linked article notes, is correlated with decreased academic achievement.  ""Stereotype threat"", a phenomenon noted by Claude Steele and discussed at length in his book *Whistling Vivaldi*, describes the way anxiety about confirming a stereotype can result in worse performance on a given task.  Whatever the reason(s), it is not ""black culture"".

Now, on to another argument of yours, OP:

&gt; The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.

Rates of violent crime are higher in black communities than white ones.  The problem is that viewing crime in the lens of ""personal responsibility"" or otherwise simply blaming criminals, punishing them, and calling it a day, is intellectually bankrupt and morally irresponsible.  And chalking it up to some vague ""black culture"" and then flooding the neighborhood with cops is certainly not a rational response.  Asking why black on black crime is a problem is a legitimate question, however.  Let's investigate.

First, most violent crimes are intraracial- white people are generally more likely to kill other white people, and black people are generally more likely to kill other black people.  You've likely heard this point before so I won't spend much time on it.

Of course, you can counter that black people still commit higher rates of violent crime, and you would be right.  However, the explanation is not as simple as ""black culture"".  [According to one study](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/623/1/93.short):

&gt; Using data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study to examine the racial-spatial dynamic of violence for neighborhoods in thirty-six U.S. cities, the authors demonstrate that along with the social and economic conditions that exist within neighborhoods, proximity to more disadvantaged and especially racially privileged (heavily white) areas is particularly critical in accounting for the large and visible differences in violence found across neighborhoods of different colors.

[Another study](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) finds that ""gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of non-white neighborhoods than in white areas (Figure 5), but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account (Table 2).""  These critical community conditions?  Differences in access to external resources (such as home loans) and socioeconomic disadvantages.

[A different study](http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/1/93.short) finds that unemployment and underemployment are significantly correlated with willingness to commit crime.  [Black unemployment rates are consistently roughly twice white unemployment rates.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/through-good-times-and-bad-black-unemployment-is-consistently-double-that-of-whites/)  [A white criminal and a black person without a criminal record have roughly the same chance of being hired.](http://csgjusticecenter.org/reentry/posts/researchers-examine-effects-of-a-criminal-record-on-prospects-for-employment/)  It's nearly impossible for black people with criminal records to get jobs, and with the War on Drugs, large numbers of black people have been swept up into the criminal justice system as felons, and permanently denied access to the economy.  Between violent criminals and nonviolent drug offenders, 1/3 of black men will be incarcerated at some point in their lives, which means 1/3 of black men will be disadvantaged in finding employment, and more likely to commit crime as a result.

You say the black community needs to tackle black on black crime.  And I agree!  It needs to tackle black on black crime by addressing it at its sources- mass incarceration, poverty, lack of services, police brutality, and segregation.  But of course, we have movements dealing with those issues.  One such movement is #BlackLivesMatter.

Anyway, moving on:

&gt; The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like ""All Lives Matter""

It is true that white people are often victims of police brutality and mass incarceration.  It's also true that black people are disproportionately victims of those things.  And another thing that is true: black people are more likely than white people to even acknowledge that a problem exists.  By calling attention to a problem white people largely don't want to realize exists, a problem born from post-civil rights movement racism masquerading as a concern for ""law and order"", of course BlackLivesMatter is going to be polarizing.  But it needs to be BlackLivesMatter because of the racist origins of our current system of mass incarceration, the disproportionate police brutality, and the havoc racism continues to inflict on black communities.  To ignore the racial aspects of our current police brutality problem is to fall short of being able to fix it and the system around it.","I think your analysis failed to address the historical roots of your points. You don't address where the stereotypes originated, you don't discuss the long term generational effects poverty and mass incarceration have on communities, and you fail to realize how social media has allowed for the dissemination of information on issues black communities face to non-black communities. 

&gt;""Hustlin'"" is glorified while education is not.

Well, this is what happens when you have an education system that has time and time again failed black communities in urban areas. I highly recommend listening to [this](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) episode of This American Life. It touches on the huge discrepancies between the education white kids receive and black kids receive in St. Louis but it's just one example that can be applied to urban communities across the country. 

 &gt;However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight.

Police brutality is another example of how a system that is meant to protect people fails to protect black communities. I don't understand why you think it's not important to address. Mike Brown's case is not only a case of a white cop killing a black boy, but an example of economic and social disparities in white and black neighborhoods. Black Lives Matters isn't about polarizing the country. Why should this issue even be polarizing? That's the main problem. Why are people still arguing that systemic racism isn't an issue in this country? That's what BLM protestors are trying to move away from - we aren't arguing anymore that race is a problem in this country, right now we're trying to address the problems of the institutions in this country. And to be honest it is working. After the two BLM protestors shut down Bernie Sander's event what happened? He released his platform on racial justice and has talked about mass incarnations and the issues of private prisons in this country. 

I think you barely grazed the surface with your analysis. It's important to look into the psychological effects systemic racism has on communities. Black communities don't trust the very institutions you think we should trust (education, police force, etc). Saying black communities should cooperate and let go of very important aspects of our culture (hip-hop, music, sports) is in and of itself oppressive. Black people in this country were never given the power to address these issues for themselves, they weren't even considered people since the day they were brought to this country, because of this we have to rely on our communities to fight for ourselves and make these issues more heard. [Here's](http://www.thenation.com/article/black-lives-matter-is-a-demand-not-a-plea/) a piece that highlights why that is important.

"&gt;Why can't a private business make the same decision?

Because, when we talk about businesses, we're usually talking about conglomerates that have formally incorporated in one way or the other.  Incorporation is a creature of statute; it's created by the government.  It's more reasonable for the government to attach strings on the benefits associated with incorporation than it is to you as an individual because they're giving the business some fancy treatment.

The government hasn't bestowed any peculiar status to you, personally.  It has bestowed a status upon most businesses, who are insulated from traditional personal liability, can choose from a myriad of different tax schemes, enter contracts as a business, and so on.","This gets posted a lot.

A private business is not a private citizen.

You are getting all sorts of sanctioned protections and services from the government. Protections like firefighters and police, and services like roads, distribution channels, domestic protection, etc etc.

Part of this contract is an agreement to provide equal services to all citizens. A business can't get all the benefits of doing business in America and then just be an asshole to certain groups for no reason.

"Is it your view that white people can criticize minorities without reservation?

I think it's also worth acknowledging that the context and audience of your criticism. If you're talking to a bunch of white people, it's worth recognizing that you all have hard to overcome biases and misconceptions about what it's like to be a minority. If you're talking to a group of black people as a white person, it's worth keeping in mind that your ethos may not be very strong. (and if you're talking to rando's on the internet both of those things may be true!)

So it may be incorrect so say as an absolute that white people can't criticize minorities, but I'd also say that it's very difficult to effectively and empathetically do so.

You might also want to consider that making moral judgements of *people* is a lot more complicated problematic than making moral judgments of *actions*. Is interrupting rude? Of course it is. But have you never done something rude? How do we begin to qualify your relative shitttyness to the BLM girl's shittyness, based on the severity and amount of rude things you two have done in your lives, in order to give your the moral high ground to criticize her character? (Assuming you think you need the moral high ground of course, but at the very least you'll agree that many people think that's an important thing.)

It's way easier to say ""it's rude to interrupt,"" and be done with it. Leave out the personal condemnations.","Sometimes you can be right and wrong at the same time.

Perhaps you are right in this one situation that it was wrong to break minor laws in order to protest.  But then you are in the game of choosing for protesters whose causes are worthy of civil disobedience and whose are not.

"There are some acts that are simply so egregious, so heinous, and so evil that juveniles, as properly understood, simply do not commit them. Some of those acts would include murder or rape. Juveniles tend to commit acts that are more misdemeanor, trivial, or immature, like stealing a pack of gum from a convenience store. 

So, how do we account for the fact some underage persons have in fact committed egregious acts like murder and rape? By concluding that these underage persons are not in fact juveniles, and probably haven't been for some time, because juveniles simply do not have the capacity to rape or murder someone.

"There are several benefits that come from learning a second (or third or more) language beyond the ability to converse in the new language. Specifically, language learning has been shown to have measurable cognitive benefits:

"The thing about being a police officer is that your job can frequently involve pretty serious situations, and it if you are on duty then it is imperative that you are fully attentive to what is going on around you. What if (and this isn't beyond the scope of ""reasonably possible"" things) while you weren't paying attention because of this, someone came up and started shooting at the crowd? It was your job to keep them safe and because you weren't paying attention, more people could have potentially been hurt? Is that likely? No, but you never know when things like that will happen so you need to be concentrating on your job.

It isn't a job-ending offense in my opinion, but people get punished for goofing off on the job all the time. It isn't really relevant that there have been worse offenses committed by police, what matters is whether his conduct was in line with what he should have been doing, and it wasn't. It was a harmless thing, but the reason you enforce conduct codes is because you never know when some seemingly ""harmless"" thing is going to lead to or allow something not so harmless to happen. 

Some punishment is fair, but it isn't a huge issue. He shouldn't lose his job but his conduct was not professional and it is totally fair to maintain a higher standard of professionalism by enforcing rules regarding conduct when on duty.

EDIT: To address several people who have mentioned this, yes obviously there is some degree of discretion involved as to what constituted ""too distracted"" and it is nice to see officers interacting positively with the community. I'm just laying out the reasoning for why this could potentially be considered an offense while on the job. As I said, it wasn't a huge deal, but you have to draw the line somewhere between ""OK behavior"" and ""distracted while on the job"", even if it isn't *likely* that anything would have happened in those 15 or 20 seconds. It's fair to say that a high-profile, controversial (to some) event like this could *potentially* break out into something that the police would need to interject into and that is why I think the rationale holds up, even if it's just a slap on the wrist and a warning to ""not do that next time"".

"I like how you've set the parameters of your question. Since it has to do with lifestyle change, rather than income I think it should be okay if we begin with a definition of middle class that isn't the standard 35K-100K household income. There are better ways to define middle class, that seem more statistically accurate. [Pew defined middle class households as those earning 67%-200% of a state's median income.](http://www.businessinsider.com/middle-class-in-every-us-state-2015-4), and that's what I'll use. But I'd like to discuss it in general, rather than get into every state's median income. In 2012, the US median household income [was almost the same as in 1990](http://www.statista.com/statistics/200838/median-household-income-in-the-united-states/).

So if median household incomes haven't risen, what's happening? In my opinion, the lifestyle change has a lot to with the fact that more and more parents delay having children than in the past, and they have fewer children too. 

&gt; [The decline in U.S. fertility has been driven primarily by a trend among young adults to postpone having children. Forty years ago, birth rates among women in their 20s were significantly higher than those of women in their 30s. In 1970, there were 168 births per 1,000 women ages 20 to 24, compared with 73 births per 1,000 women ages 30 to 34. However, this gap has steadily narrowed over time. By 2009—for the first time in U.S. history—birth rates among women ages 30 to 34 (97.5 births per 1,000 women) exceeded those for women ages 20 to 24 (96 births per 1,000 women). In 2010, the birth rate among teens dropped to 34 births per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19—the lowest level ever recorded in the United States.](http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-us-population.aspx)

More parents take the time establish their careers before they have children than in the past. The stability and increased income from a more stable career let them provide a very different lifestyle for their children. So more money is available for fewer children - that's your answer.

"You raise two points, but really only address one.

* Teaching personal finance
* Encouraging saving

Teaching personal finance you mention, then pretty much ignore. I think teaching personal finance is essential. It is a life skill that will impact everybody. There aren't many high school subjects that can make that claim.

How many people will have a credit card during their lifetime? Shouldn't we explain to them things like what an APR is and how much paying only the minimum due actually costs? Perhaps help kids understand how much a car really costs beyond just the money they need to put up for a down payment? How does a bank account work and how do I open one? How does paying taxes work? How many deductions should I claim on a W4 when I start a new job? What is a credit rating and how does it affect me? These are important life skills that we don't even attempt to address in high school.

A separate question is whether such a personal finance course should encourage saving. I maintain it should. At an honors level I'd consider going further and teaching basics of investments.

US savings rates are low. Very low. Here's a chart from the St Louis Fed showing the US personal savings rate over the last 60 years:

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PSAVERT

Here's a list from the World Bank showing Gross Savings as a % of GDP:

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc

For us to increase savings from this baseline to a level where the drop in consumption was enough to cause a problem just isn't a realistic concern. On the other hand, we continually expect people to be more capable of taking care of themselves with less help. Defined Benefit Plans are a thing of the past, replaced by Defined Contribution Plans. Retirement savings in vehicles such as a 401k or IRA require the individual to do at least some management of their own assets.

As an econ student you know the power of compounding, but not everybody does. Beginning your retirement savings in your 20s has a massive effect on when you can retire and how well you can live in retirement. 

http://www.businessinsider.com/compound-interest-and-young-people-2015-4

Not everybody can afford to start saving at a young age, but why not explain to them in high school what the effects are and why it helps to try?","You seem to be conflating ""saving"" with ""putting wads of cash under the mattress.""  A saving account accrues interest (albeit very slowly), because it's not just a storage place for your money but rather a very very low-risk investment.  Investments are by definition driving economic growth.  Every piece of value that anyone has ever made is the result of an investment of time, money, or both.  We should *absolutely* be teaching young people about investing, both for their own personal return and for the sake of communal economic growth.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and comprehensive argument for why teaching personal finance and encouraging saving is important. It addresses specific examples of what should be taught in a personal finance course and provides data on low savings rates in the US. Additionally, it explains the benefits of starting to save at a young age and the power of compounding, making a strong case for why these topics should be included in high school curriculum.",0
"I'm not going to defend FPH. I don't think they are good human beings, and I don't think that hate of any sort is conducive to happiness.

And that's exactly why FPH should not have been deleted. When you destroy their containment tank, they leak onto the rest of the website. That is precisely what happened. The sheer amount of fat hating posts that have been upvoted with a vengeance on /r/all in the past few days is nothing short of staggering. Prior to the deletion of the sub, I had literally never heard of those people. Now they're everywhere.

You should look at /u/yishan 's announcements, in which he used to say that Reddit would never censor content that it found objectionable (legality aside), this is what Reddit was founded upon and why people have become so attached to it.

Free speech is a principle. Reddit's community always prided itself for not letting personal feeling stop other people from expressing their views within this community (no matter how offensive the views are).

"&gt;My experience has been limited to the tech sector 

This is why. Most people who are complaining about failing to find jobs go for things they love, yet struggle to find jobs for it. 

So, for example, Philosophy has a 9.3% unemployment rate, while Chemical Engineering has a 2.2% unemployment rate [(source)](http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3?sort=Rate).

"Many folks here will talk about how not all public schools are the same.  I've lived in four different states, and can attest to that.

But more importantly *not all children are the same*.  Public school is geared toward the average- if you are above or below - or outside - of the norm, public school is often a difficult or unproductive place for you.

One of my children is an advanced learner.  She could read well before Kindergarten - mostly self taught.  Guess how boring K was for her.

My other daughter is extremely creative and high energy - sitting in a classroom all day was problematic for her.

We homeschooled our family 13 years, which allowed for personalized learning for both students that fit their learning styles.  We are an atheist family and were members of a secular homeschool group with roughly 300 families.  My kids now - one is a successful adult and the other has decided to transition into public school and is looking forward to high school.

Your views on homeschool are, to put it bluntly, ignorant.  The kids are usually more socially adept as they are required to get along with kids of different ages as well as adults.  Kids learn from the older kids and mentor the younger ones.  

Because of the shortfalls of many public school systems, homeschool groups will often have a higher percentage of students with special needs.  In recent years we've seen quite an uptick of older kids with autism, for example.   So the perception many have of socially awkward/weird homeschool kids - remember the student may be in homsechool *because of a special need*.

Also - you show your ignorance again when you talk about how great your public school was. ""We had a trip to Europe!""  Jesus, how oblivious to the rest of the world can you be.  If your school went to Europe, your public school was likely in an affluent area and was practically private school quality. 

My school had a drug cop with a narc sniffing dog.

Private school being ""better"" is also kind of vague. For education, you get out what you put in. If you try hard in school, you will get a  better education.

"I don't think it's a good idea to base anything on the manifestos of crazy people.  I think you're equating a scientifically-backed principle with a symbol of a defunct rebel government.  It sounds like what you're saying is that because someone has killed in the name of X, X should not be taught or celebrated.

In fact, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a principle that someone *hasn't* killed someone over.  Just about every religion fits this bill, as well as every governmental system.  If you try to suss out the one that hasn't had any blood spilled, you'd be as silly as  that scene from Rain Man in the airport.

"&gt; Evidence that a wage increase would not result in the loss of unskilled jobs to outsourcing, automation etc...

Different studies show different effects in both directions. However, [an analysis of 64 studies](http://www.cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/studying-the-studies-on-the-minimum-wage) regarding minimum wage and teenage employment concluded that most studies, and the most precise studies, showed raising the minimum wage had little or no effect on employment levels. 

Also, a different meta-analysis, from [here](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf) (PDF warning):

&gt; Paul Wolfson and Dale Belman have carried out their own meta-analysis of the minimum wage,
focusing on studies published only since 2000. They identified 27 minimum wage studies...They then produced a range of meta-estimates, controlling for many features of the underlying studies, including the type of worker analyzed (teens or fast foodworkers), whether the study focused on the supply or the demand side of the labor market, who the authors of the study were, and other characteristics. **The resulting estimates varied, but revealed no statistically significant negative employment effects of the minimum wage.**","how about this (the conclusion of the study): [""Economists have conducted hundreds of studies of the employment impact of the minimum wage. Summarizing those studies is a daunting task, but two recent meta-studies analyzing the research conducted since the early 1990s concludes that the minimum wage has little or no discernible effect on the employment prospects of low-wage workers. The most likely reason for this outcome is that the cost shock of the minimum wage is small relative to most firms' overall costs and only modest relative to the wages paid to low-wage workers. In the traditional discussion of the minimum wage, economists have focused on how these costs affect employment outcomes, but employers have many other channels of adjustment. Employers can reduce hours, non-wage benefits, or training. Employers can also shift the composition toward higher skilled workers, cut pay to more highly paid workers, take action to increase worker productivity (from reorganizing production to increasing training), increase prices to consumers, or simply accept a smaller profit margin. Workers may also respond to the higher wage by working harder on the job. But, probably the most important channel of adjustment is through reductions in labor turnover, which yield significant cost savings to employers.""](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf)

"I am late to comment on this, but as a father of a deaf child I feel a need to chime in. If for no other reason in that at some point in our lives it may be my son on the other side of this scenario. I am basing my comments on the assumption only deafness and not any other special need is at play here.

At the time of posting I am going to try to change your &amp;#8710; back at least in the sense of repercussions and kicking out the family. Don’t worry about the theater. They have policies in place that their lawyers have approved.

I would never apologize for my son’s deafness. But, I do have to understand that it will play a role in social interaction especially in public situations.

I believe the parents should decide if it is appropriate for him to see that movie or not. Do all parents automatically know what is best or appropriate for their child? Of course not. I can only speak for my sons and our situation and each parent should be able to decide for their own case. Right or wrong.

My son is only two years old and I would not take him to a movie like Jurassic World. However, my wife and I are looking to take him to his first movie in about two weeks. His older brother wants to see the new Pixar film. My son can sit and watch an entire animated film at home, he loves Cars and Despicable Me. It keeps his attention and he understands “sit down” and “quiet” when we sign it to him. He is as well behaved as much as a two year old can be expected to be in public. We are going on a weekday and attending the first showing of the day as opposed to packed Saturday night.

Honestly, all of this forethought isn’t for his consideration. It is for the peace of mind my wife and I will have in attempting to enjoy a family outing. If he acts up during the movie, then one of us will remove him while the other sits with his older brother and watches the remainder of the film. If my son was being disruptive like you described, neither my wife nor myself would be able to enjoy ourselves. 

If it is truly bothering you and you can’t enjoy the movie that you paid for, then let the movie theatre know. Find a manager and explain yourself, hopefully that person will have enough experience and maybe even some training on handling this scenario. ADA laws require equal access and treatment. By law they have to accommodate his disability, but not his disruptive behavior. 

However you handle this, don’t approach the parents yourself. Trust me, they know their child has special needs. If they are socially conscious of it, then they will act on their own or if a theatre employee says something. Chances are in this situation they probably have tuned him out and will probably react badly to you pointing it out to them.

I know if we were approached by someone giving their opinion on how we should raise/treat/control/educate our kid my hot blooded Italian wife would be a lot more disruptive than my son ever would be. Unless you are a parent of a kid that has special needs you don’t know the feeling associated with hearing that news for the first time. You don’t know the misery of sitting and pacing in waiting room for multiple surgeries. You don’t know the hours and hours spent on therapy, audiology, doctors appointments, sign language classes. You don’t know the stress of lost work and pay because you need to make these appointments driving all over town. You don’t know the struggles with insurance companies and everything you have to pay for out of pocket. You don’t know the fights with schools districts, IFSPs and later IEPs. You don’t know how draining it can be to try to teach someone that has no concept of volume how to be quiet when appropriate.

This trip to the movies could be a reward for hard work or hitting a milestone or accomplishment. It may have been something this kid specifically asked his parents for.

Everything I just said above isn’t to dissuade you from doing something. It is just a bit of perspective on the other side of your experience. To us, being deaf isn’t a disability for our son. We treat him like we do our hearing son.  Sometimes being told to be quiet when you are noisy at the movies is part of growing up and realizing that the world doesn’t revolve around you. 

TL;DR: My son is deaf. Let me decide what is and isn’t appropriate. Don’t tell them to be quiet yourself. Ask the theater to do something about it or ask for a refund.
 
Edit: formatting

Edit #2: I suck at formatting","I agree with you, but let me try and argue the opposite anyway.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Assuming the child in question only has deafness (and leaving aside any other hanidcaps for now), it is technically possible that when you encounter a situation like yours, it may have been the child's first time going to the movies. Or even going out to a public 'event' at all. While principally I would say that in public, a person should never act at their own behest if it inconveniences another, there is an argument to be made that as responsible as we may want to make the parents, it is impossible for them to fully control their children 100% of the time. Things like behaving in public take practice, and if a child is just beginning that practice then it isn't impossible that the parents may need to tell him to shut up multiple times. Which could cause a major inconvenience for other movie-go'ers, even if the parents try their damnedest to keep control.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Look at it this way: if you ever get a baby, you'll know that it will likely have the tendency to break into uncontrollable crying every now and then, sometimes for seemingly no reason. If you really want to never let this inconvenience others, you will literally not be able to take a walk to the park with your son or daughter. When the child grows older, you can try to teach him not to make a ruckus in public, but he will nevertheless still need to experience what 'public' is before he'll understand.

"It's because race is a social construct. There's no inherent sense of racial identity wired into our brains like there is with gender identity because there is no biological reality that race is tied to. Gender identity is related to sex, which is a biological reality and shapes our brain chemistry, our hormones, etc. But race is an arbitrary social invention and has changed wildly over time and from culture to culture.

Hormone therapy, sex reassignment, etc. are all used as treatments for this disease. It's important to note that this is a medical condition that can be diagnosed and treated.

AFAIK Rachel Dolezal is not suffering from any mental illness. She took on a black identity as she felt  *sympatico* with black culture and experience. And in her chosen field of study being a black woman added an aura of authenticity to her art, writings, teaching and other work.

"Former civics teacher here. Regarding your statement that 

&gt; Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no ""Bill of Responsibilities""

and the implication that we need to refer more to responsibilities of citizenship, I agree 100%. There is a sense of entitlement among American citizens today; I can't say if it's existed in other epochs, but it does seem to have a deleterious effect on our political discourse, and on civil society more generally.

That said, the notion that

&gt; Rights are a myth

and

&gt; 'Rights' are not a real thing. They exist only as much as the state allows

is a dangerous one. The notion of limited government, i.e. a government created of, by, and for the people, which can only create new laws within the framework of a constitution, exists to protect citizens from the excesses of unchecked government power. The companion notion of natural rights is necessary for the conception of limited government. If, as you claim, rights come *from the government*, what stops government from switching things up and determining that, for example, we don't have a right to due process? (Some would argue that this is already happening, but I'll get to that in a moment.) That we don't have a right to the proceeds of our labor? What if the President decided that he needed a new palace, that term limits--hell, even those pesky elections--aren't really necessary, and so he upped the tax rate to near 100% and declared himself emperor? Historically, all a ruler needs is the support of the elites and the military to make that happen. A generally-accepted belief in limited government and natural rights doesn't inherently prevent these abuses, but it's a very good first step. (It's especially a good step because the members of the military, who generally aren't the elites, will have been conditioned to believe in limited government just as they have been conditioned to follow strict lines of authority, so they're less likely to quietly sign on to a power grab by a rogue President.)

As to your point below that 

&gt; 'rights' aren't about compromise; they're about entitlement

this is patently false. Rights will necessarily conflict. There are very few moral systems that argue that there are not overlaps in rights, where priority must be given to some over others. (Modern American libertarians would make the argument that the Non-Aggression Principle is a single rule to determine all disputes, but this is problematic in its own right; for example, it allows for the extreme interpretation that my current self cannot 'enslave' my future self by signing contracts, making the entire institution of binding agreements null and void. I think that any moral system with this level of ""clarity"" necessarily tends toward allowing absurdity like this, if not actively encouraging it.) This is the reason we require a (preferably impartial) judiciary: to determine the precedence and priority of various rights. For example, in the most famous example, my 1st Amendment right to yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater has been deemed, rightfully, to be trumped by society's collective right not to have its citizens deliberately cause physical harm to others. (You could very easily frame that collective right as my responsibility not to cause physical harm to others, and I would agree with it.)

But wait, you say, that's **government** determining rights! You're [I am] wrong! Rights *do* come from government!

Well, not quite. As a civil society, we need some arbiter that we can all appeal to when our rights come into conflict. Since government has existed seemingly since time immemorial, we have attempted to harness its power to that end. And that's all government is, a way of aggregating power. We like to think that it represents and protects all of us, but government is very easily captured by people who have disproportionate power or wealth to begin with, making it a dangerous tool. Yes, we need government (or some other collectively agreeable arbiter) to decide questions of *whose rights or responsibilities win out in a conflict*, but that doesn't mean the rights in question came from government in the first place. Just because a corrupt government chooses not to protect a set of rights, or actively chooses to violate them (as many police forces seem to be ignoring our 4th Amendment rights, especially in seeking out citizens with drugs), **does not** mean that we didn't have that right to begin with. It is a precondition for challenging the government to the extent necessary to restore the rights. If, as you say, rights *come from government*, then we should ignore public outrage about the TSA, about the War on Drugs, about Ferguson and Baltimore and the myriad places where cops kill people of color, because those are all instances of government agents acting against private citizens. And if those agents, acting according to the rules of their agencies (which can't be doubted, since officers in these situations are extremely rarely prosecuted or punished), have denied citizens their rights, including their right to life, then that right must not have existed in the first place, right?","I'm not here to completely change your mind. On the responsibilities note:

My understanding of rights-based political philosophy is that rights are the bare minimum of what peoples generally agree on as the bare minimum of requirements for people to be able to pursue something like freedom or a good life. Rights aren't enabling you to do anything - they are restricting the government from interfering in your life. (The most cited example of this misunderstanding in the US is people who say ridiculous things and then cite the first amendment of the US constitution- the first amendment limits government censorship - not fellow citizens.)

The responsibilities bit is not brought up because (1) it is presupposed that most people won't step-up and (2) taking responsibility in open society has its own rewards. So on the first note, guess what there were drunks/deadbeats/dropouts in every day and age - and so you know that some people aren't even capable of a full public life (ie voting, volunteering, getting involved in the community, stepping up at work, etc, etc). Also, to be fair, a lot political philosophy was only about property-owning men - their very lives were based on their supremacy over everyone else. So for instance, you couldn't argue that non-property owning men and women would have public responsibilities because it would undermine the mental model of inferior women and non-property owners.

Point two, where responsibility is its own reward:
The other aspect of it is that it was assumed that if you became part of public society you got to do all these other fun things: dances, you could network for your job or future wife, meet interesting people, potentially take political office, siphon public funds etc etc.

The rights model is based on a morally-normative model and is therefore problematic. But this was known quite a long time ago: even Spinoza's (mid-1600's) political philosophy, more or less, replaces rights with abilities and interest.

But all philosophy aside- what is of dire interest to me is why Americans seem to be (1) uninterested in history and or (2) unwilling to hold our government to the basic principles of both our constitution and our founding.

It's very interesting to me that people rationalize government misdeeds and overreaches - or make ironic jokes about them. (""I'm sure I'm on a list somewhere."") Or they may simply shrug and say: ""They are only catching the bad guys."" As if that isn't how every horrifying misdeed starts or somehow makes it better that they lied to American congress.

Your terminology is slightly off.",1,1,True,Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of the importance of rights in limiting government power and preventing abuses.

"&gt;The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience... The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.

Oliver wendal Holmes

You're right, the decision rendered today is s tad bit arbitrary. Anyone who's knowledgable and honest will admit that. But we currently have 38 states that allow SSM. The SCOTUS simply standardized a legal regime throughout the country because the people have essentially settled this issue. Their ruling reflects the whete society is today, not what's going to be.

So your view is incorrect because the SCOTUS is just trying to interpret law as society currently understands the law. It doesn't strive to be a math equation.","The basis of the Supreme Court's decision was the equal protection clause. The reason why the Court ruled the way that it did, was because the definition of marriage excluded an entire category of people.

Not every legal categorization is given heightened scrutiny by the courts. For instance, legal discrimination on the basis of age is typically legal. When the court asks whether a legal classification is ""suspect"" under the Equal Protection clause, they ask whether the subject class is:


* The group has historically been discriminated against, and/or have been subject to prejudice, hostility, and/or stigma, perhaps due, at least in part, to stereotypes. 

* possesses an immutable and/or highly visible trait. Lyng v. Castillo. 

* are powerless to protect themselves via the political process.  U.S. v. Carolene Products.

* The group's distinguishing characteristic does not inhibit it from contributing meaningfully to society. Frontiero v. Richardson.

So today's decision wasn't arbitrary. And these factors probably don't apply to polygamists. There are guidelines for this sort of stuff. ",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of the legal basis for the Supreme Court's decision and outlines the criteria for legal classifications to be considered ""suspect"" under the Equal Protection clause. By breaking down the factors that determine whether a group is protected under the clause, Response 1 effectively argues that polygamists do not meet these criteria and therefore the decision was not arbitrary. This logical and structured argument is likely to be more persuasive in changing the OP's view.",0
"That's not a bug, it's a feature. Creating law **should** be a long, arduous process. If it were easy to pass laws, we would experience dramatic shifts in policy every time the power shifted between parties. With the lumber state of our bureaucracy, the rapid back and forth between policy would essentially cripple our government worse than it is now. The mandatory elimination of phase-in policies would wreck things by itself, even if you ignore the specific impacts of the law. . Imagine if something like the ACA had gone into full effect the day it was passed. It would have been complete and utter chaos and crashed the healthcare system until it was repealed the day after the next election, which would then cause a similar amount of chaos as people try to revert to the prior system, until the *next* election when the Dems win and start this all over again.

Additionally, case law with regards to new legislation often takes years to resolve. So what do we do when the other party repeals the law and passes a new one in it's place? Do we use the old law, since at the time of commission, the act in question was illegal? If not, why would anyone ever bother to obey the new laws, since they have a high probability of being overturned. If we do use the old law, how do we resolve the moral quandary of sending someone to prison for something that we as a society have decided is not illegal? It would ruin the courts. Why would they even bother trying cases based on any new law?

Two chambers also allows for further division also provides for a *necessary* separation of powers within the legislative branch. The authority to take *literally* anything you can think of is an absurd amount of power to concentrate in the hands of one chamber. It also allows for diversity of function (ie impeachment proceedings), and diversity of procedure/processes that improve the process.

Finally, both proportional and flat representation are inherently unfair to *some* segment of the population. Proportional screws of sparsely populated states, making their interests less likely to be heard, and their votes less relevant (as if we didn't already have a voter apathy issue). The senate counters this, preventing a full-blow tyranny of the majority, and giving everyone an equal vote/voice. Of course, this disadvantages populous states, but they have the house to compensate. It balances itself.","Two things:  
  
One, the system is slow and inefficient by design.  The whole idea is that we don't want to be passing laws based on knee jerk reactions.  We already do that, but it would be much worse if the process were streamlined and efficient.  
  
Two, the reason for two houses is to prevent tyranny of the majority.  If there were only a single house that had proportional representation, then large / highly populated states would always trump smaller ones.  The Senate exists to prevent that, by guaranteeing that every state has the same voice regardless of size.  On the other hand, having only the Senate would artificially inflate the importance of small / less populated states.  Having two houses, each with different representation, allows different regions to have equal representation while also taking into account population size.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of the importance of a long, arduous legislative process, the necessity of two chambers to prevent tyranny of the majority, and the balance between different types of representation.

"I actually agree with you, but there's a couple of things that I think might be able to prevent this for occurring.

Nanobot implants inserted into the brain could help cure degenerative diseases in the future. Beyond that, they could go on to boost human capabilities to machine like levels.

It's possible that humans may be able to compete with machines for jobs in the future because of this. It wouldn't be an ideal scenario, but it would maintain the status quo. That could be a dangerously powerful effect. A structure that forces people into strengthening that structure could persist long after it has become redundant. 


The other thing is a bit simpler. The dream is that machines do all the work while humans live a life of leisure, right? But, maybe a life of leisure wouldn't be all that enjoyable. Human desire to build something for themselves or be remembered could keep people working. Maybe not in a way that you'd call ""labour"" but on personal and collaborative projects or works that they share with others.","I agree that most unskilled labor jobs will be made redundant. But it won't be as bad as most people think, here's why:

Almost everyone forgets about competition. There will be multiple companies in the future automating food production / delivery / sales. These companies will compete on price. As they both save costs by automating they will lower their prices (if you don't lower your prices no one will shop with you and you'll go out of business). Eventually this will drive the cost of food to almost zero. 

Similar events will unfold in housing, clothing and other markets. 

Once this happens it will be fairly easy for people to have their basic needs met at almost zero cost and the government will provide this for them (else they'll be riots, that's what happens when people get hungry). 

Now skilled labor in research and technology won't go away for a long, long time (at least until they invent real AI). There is literally infinite technology we can invent and create and almost infinite medical problems to solve. We could have all 7 billion people in the world working in technology and medicine and we still wouldn't have anywhere near enough. For anyone that wants to work and puts in the effort to get into these fields there will be an endless supply of things to do. ",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a more optimistic outlook on the future, highlighting the potential for competition to drive down costs and make basic needs more accessible. It also emphasizes the endless possibilities in research and technology, suggesting that there will always be work available for those willing to put in the effort.

"&gt;great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia

It's not supposed to be utopian. It's just ""we have a series of things in our economic system that are really fucked up in many ways, if we did this and that, we end up with a less fucked up system"".

&gt;In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.

A basic knowledge of Marx tells you that the revolution required an informed industrial proletariat. The examples you give were full of illiterate peasants.

&gt;First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.

Not how it works. Socialism and communism *mostly* care about the property of the *means of production*.

&gt;That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”.

It's not like Tsarist Russia was better. Also not like Russia with Putin has improved much. Many relevant metrics peaked during the late USSR. But yeah, it was obviously far from perfect.

Funny how you never hear the same ""it doesn't work because we're not perfect"" with capitalism, though.

&gt;All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc.

Those are mere concessions pried with sweat by the workers from the State that oppresses them.","&gt; Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism [...]

Socialism is by no means a precursor to anything, let alone communism. The notion of socialism preceding communism was a Marxist idea, probably propaganda, and is surely false considering the numerous countries that have successfully implemented democratic socialism, for instance: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Australia (formerly) and New Zealand (formerly). One could argue that the United States used to be a democratic socialist country following the New Deal reforms from 1933-38.

&gt; [...] are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich.

Again, be careful not to confuse the very broad concept of **socialism**, encompassing ideologies ranging from social democracy to revolutionary socialism, with **communism**, which broadly encompasses Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, anarcho-communism and others.

&gt; However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist.

This is incredibly broad and vague, but if you're referring to the collapse of numerous *communist* power structures, then this is probably more often than not due to the undermining of left ideologies through American foreign policy, especially in regard to countries like Cuba. Cuba is also worth assessing since it is a third-world country and still has a higher life expectancy and a more efficient and accessible health-care system than the United States.

&gt; In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.

Neither Russia nor China were socialist countries. It was their propaganda systems that declared themselves as socialist. For instance, nobody really believes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is democratic.

&gt; First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.

This is *not* socialism. At all. You really ought to research socialism as a political theory for yourself, since this sentence mirrors the sound bites heard from the Cato Institute and AEI.

"Any time you find yourself using a microeconomics example to address a macroeconomics problem; you're *probably* making a mistake.

The short answer is sustainability.  The government is not in the business of moralizing but it is in the business of survival.

Lets take Uber's request for the first 500K self driving Google cars as an example.  Here we have a company run by *relatively* few people.  With this acquisition alone, it will remove 500K jobs from the job market.  Those people will go on unemployment while they *attempt* to look for more work.  

On the flip side, all of the people working at Uber will make more money and will pay *a little* more in taxes.  But only incrementally so.  Without a progressive tax system, the amount of money generated by the additional tax is not nearly enough to offset the loss from unemployment alone.

That is one example within an entire generation of change.  We're seeing a shift in wealth faster than ever before and without progressive taxation, there just won't be enough money to run the country.  It's not about morality or fairness.  It has nothing to do with anything the politicians say to pander to one side or the other.  It's just survival.","I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the progressive income tax system.

Everyone pays the exact same amount in taxes per dollar earned.  You're just taxed more on your millionth dollar earned than you are on your first dollar earned.  Thus billionaires and people working at McDonalds pay the same tax rates on their earnings.  It's just that McDonalds workers never get hit the higher brackets, so their average tax rate is lower as a result.  But make no mistake that both people are taxed equally and fairly.

As for your other point about only paying taxes for services you consume, I think you're completely missing the point of government.  Instead of a pizza place where you pay for the pizza you eat, you should think of government more like an insurance company where money is pooled.  **Insurance would be pointless if you only paid for damage to your property.**  Similarly government is pointless if everyone is just covering their individual costs or needs case by case.

"Just out of curiosity, do you happen to be a lesbian, other flavor of LBGT, or black?

It amuses me when I hear lots straight people *insisting* that their use of the word faggot or gay couldn't possibly be offensive because it wasn't directed at me and wasn't intended to put me down. It never seems to occur to them that their frame of reference simply can't predict what will and won't be hurtful, or that the solution ""let's just use it a lot so that you become numb to the original meaning"" isn't a good solution.

I suppose that comes off as condescending. I really shouldn't do that, but this sort of thinking frustrates me. I'm a believer in descriptivist linguistics, so I understand the argument, but this is a different ball game. I could go on about normalization, discrimination and so forth, but I'd rather just talk about outcomes.

If you had asked me in the mid 2000's, when faggot and gay were really in prime use, I would have told you that it didn't really bother me. I had in fact become numb to their use. Now in 2015, it's slightly rarer to even see people saying ""that's so gay"", I can honestly say this state of language is 100% preferable to earlier.

Saying a word is just uttering it. Using a word is, in the case of slurs, throwing it at people. 

Saying slurs for the purpose of discussing their oppressive backgrounds, their history, as part of a story or whatever else is absolutely fine, because its use in that context is not a form of oppression.

Using slurs, as in saying this words to imply negative connotation or to harass people is unacceptable. Slurs are verbal weapons, and while continued use may lessen the impact, it normalizes the idea that the target of this slur bears x qualities (usually negative ""I look like a dyke today"" ""I smell like a nigger"") This hurts the targets of these slurs, even if they're not there to hear it, by perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Also as a gay guy who was bullied, having someone like a friend use ""faggot"" to describe someone or ""faggoty"" to describe something (again, generally to put it down) really upsets me, just how people can't bear to see knives or scissors after being attacked with one, It's hard for me to hear the word after being attacked with one, so I politely tell my friends to please tone down the slurs.

"It's always frustrating when people rail against feminists who say outrageous things without actually providing links to the offending speech, since it forces other feminists to apologize for what might be a misrepresentation of the thing they actually said. But here goes nothing:

1. A feminist might say that men shouldn't use violence against women because men are powerful enough to defend themselves against women without needing to resort to very much violence, or any violence at all. What they're trying to express might be the idea that since you're only justified in using as much force as is reasonable to prevent harm to yourself, and that men could in most cases prevent a woman from inflicting any sort of meaningful harm on them with a very minimal use of force, men shouldn't use very much force when protecting themselves from women. I think this is an overgeneralization; some men are really weak and some women are really strong, and that matters in evaluating when and how much force is justified. Some men are perfectly justified in using a lot of force against a woman to defend themselves. But the underlying principle, that men should be careful not to use too much force when defending themselves against women, is a good one, and I don't think it very charitable to declare all of contemporary feminism flawed because some, *not all*, feminists are making a hasty generalization.

2. This one is easy; a tree is not a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, so getting drunk and crashing into a tree is entirely your fault. However, a person who wants to have sex with you *is* a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, and if such a  person decides to fuck you while your capacity for rational decision making has been subverted by alcohol, they are raping you. So comparing a drunk driving accident to being raped while intoxicated is a disanalogy. Feminists see this bad comparison made *a lot*, so you're not alone in this error. It's like the [Wasson selection task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7NE7apn-PA) of feminist thought.

3. If you ask feminists about the draft, most will give you a two pronged answer; first, that women should be allowed to serve in the military in any capacity in which they are able, including combat, and second, that nobody should be forced to serve against their will. That's an implicit argument that the draft is unjust, so essentially you're asking why feminists aren't outraged that women aren't also subjected to this unjust treatment which men are subjected. If they're right that any sort of draft is unjust, and I think they are, then you're asking feminists to beat women down here rather than raise men up, which is a perverted sort of justice if you ask me. You might want to say that feminists should advocate for ending the draft, and that's fine. Problem is, feminist activists tend to be women, and women are perfectly justified in focusing on issues that affect them. They aren't obligated to focus their activism on men's issues. Feminists who are men are perfectly capable of addressing the draft issue, and should do just that. Heck, you could do that yourself, right now!

Alright, so to wrap this up; if you approach feminism in good faith and in a non-facile way, you're going to find that the project as a whole is not at all flawed or hypocritical. Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious your exposure to feminism has been via the bad faith arguments typical of the MRA/redpill/etc. movements. I highly recommend learning about feminism from sources that aren't explicitly hostile to it. Read bell hooks' [*Feminism is for Everybody*](http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332), it's a really great intro to feminism, especially for people like you who have been exposed to it uncharitably.

e: Also, I'm only going to reply to OP.","1. It's wrong to hit anybody. Men *shouldn't* ever lay a hand on a woman nor should they lay their hand on a man. And when feminists are talking about equality they're not making the claim that women are as physically strong on average as men. They're talking about equal value as a human being in society, not physical prowess.

2. ""Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges."" Is this what really happens most often? Or, is it more often the case that the female is drunk, the man is not, and he takes advantage of the situation. Two drunk people having a one-night stand does not result in rape charges nearly as often as one sober and one drunk/unconscious person does. 

3. First of all, there are feminist groups such as SWAN (Service Women's Action Network) who push for female-inclusion in Selective Service. Second, the Draft is not a relevant issue today. Neither you nor anyone else is going to be drafted any time soon. Feminist groups--like any politically-active group--typically focus on *relevant* issues that actually affect people. So it's no wonder you don't see a lot of attention placed on it by feminist groups because at this point it doesn't really affect anyone one way or the other. Yes, men have to sign up for it, but it's only a relic of a system that is no longer used. If people were actively drafted and the majority of feminists supported the current system, you might have a point. But since the draft is not something that is likely to happen any time in the near future, you can't really blame feminists for wanting focus on more relevant issues.

It's difficult to address your problems with feminism because you haven't brought up any specific examples of mainstream feminists. You have no citations. There are also multiple schools of thought on feminism so I don't know if you're attacking intersectional feminism, third-wave feminism, both, neither, etc.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides detailed explanations and examples to counter the OP's arguments, addressing each point raised in a thoughtful and logical manner.

"&gt;I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.

What constitutes a valid representation? Art that depicts life invariably gets details wrong, compresses the complicated or what isn't as noticeable to the artist.  It will always be a flawed representation because it isn't the event itself.  At its best, the only thing art can hope to do is capture the *spirit* of the thing.

So what does it need to depict and to what degree of accuracy before it is considered valid?  Do you imagine historians could form a consensus on this?  Different historians value different aspects of history and disagree with each other as to what precisely happened at any given time, so I highly doubt it.  They would *all* tell you a given film got things wrong, but they would each care about certain errors more than others; one might dispute the ethnicity of a historical figure as cast, one might complain about anachronistic dialogue, another might object to the favorable/disfavorable view of group X doing thing Y at Z point in history.  All the while, other historians will be saying it's as good as it needs to be to convey the necessary information.

&gt;A person who knows absolutely nothing about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching JFK (1991). And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.

That could be said about any depiction of history, including primary sources that describe historical events and provide the basis of our understanding of most of history.  Herodotus is referred to as ""The Father of History"" because he was the first in European history to systematically gather evidence and form a historiographic narrative.  He  didn't just make errors, he produced propagandistic falsehoods to make Greeks (especially Athenians) look like the best thing since sliced bread.  The idea that the Persian's brought over a million men to fight the 300 Spartans (and a few thousands allies) at Thermopylae comes from Herodotus.  Some of the inaccuracies you see in ""300"" can be traced back to the first recorded account of the battle itself.

&gt;Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary.

*Zeitgeist* claims that it is a documentary, it is full of shit.  Bill Maher's *Religulous* used some of the same evidence to try and argue that Jesus was a myth, he is full of shit. *Triumph of the Will* is, in a sense, a documentary.  *Super Size Me* was a groundbreaking documentary...the results of which nobody has been able to reproduce.

If you want to learn history, you shouldn't be trusting one source that claims to give you the full story; especially one that is deliberately packaged to entertain you.  You should gather as many opinions on the subject as you can through any media you like and figure out what you think happened based on those opinions.  If you're particularly competent and interested, you can try looking at original source material and try to interpret what it means.

What you should *never* do is assume that the movie or documentary you just watched gave you significant historical education.","You seemingly answered and changed your own view by the end of your post.

"I think you're overlooking the fact that most of the progress that we've made so far (racism, sexism, etc.) has been because members of both groups have united against the problem. For example, when women finally achieved the right to vote it wasn't simply because all women wanted to vote, while all men didn't want this; members of both groups united and tackled the problem.

But there's always blowback because not everyone wants to join, not everyone is as progressive as you think they are. Your view is (slightly) naive because it doesn't take into account that there are those people who accept (an out of balance) status quo and are willing to defend it. A simple example on Reddit is TRP. Feminists welcome men and women to work for the equality of women, but this doesn't go down too well with everyone so there are counter-movements. TRP is an example of a lot of stupid people who aren't comfortable with change because they don't understand it or because they feel that it's going too far.","&gt; Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting.

This sounds great on the surface, but fails horribly in practice. Most racism and sexism happens subconsciously. A white man is going to want to hire other white men. It's not that he's racist; it's just that we like people that are like us. Unless you point out this behavior and make him conscious of it, it will continue on forever.

Likewise, a police department may arrest black people at a higher proportion than white people. It's not that they are racist, but the arrest records show that black people are more likely to be criminals; a connection is made in your mind. Making it a visible topic, you get the chance to consider whether black people really *are* more likely to be criminals, or if it is a self-perpetuating bias.",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more nuanced and realistic perspective on the issue of racism and sexism.

"I'm primarily a lurker and a fairly new one at that, however, in my time here I've seen the value of CMV fairly quickly. The idea of the sub is not to force people to conform, but rather to provide people with legitimate evidence and logical reasoning that they might not be privy to. 

Additionally, when group think is applied in a logical and critical manner, there is nothing wrong with it. Consider this, if people constantly argue and debate things and *only* change their opinions when presented with solid (logical) reasoning, reasoning which they view as better than their own, the final conclusions reached by the majority of individuals will be the conclusions with the greatest basis in logic and fact. Now, this idea is slightly problematic in that it requires everyone to be logical in their reasoning and to only accept sound arguments. However, this very problem is perhaps one of the reasons reddit, and the internet in general, is a great place for such an activity. As I'm sure you are aware simply from spending time on the internet, people are much less afraid to attack positions aggressively and to present some of their ideals which may normally be less socially acceptable.

"I'm a native New Yorker. It's really not as smelly or dirty as you make it out to be, though it can be quite expensive if you want to live in certain areas of the city.

&gt; There is trash everywhere, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. 

There are plenty clean and nice spots in the city. I was just at [Gentry State Park](http://cityphile.com/photo/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Gantry-State-Park-4897.jpg), where I didn't see any litter and even saw some people kayaking on the East River during sunset. I'm originally from Queens, where there are plenty of quiet, nice-smelling neighborhoods.[ Forest Hills](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Forest_Hills_Gardens,_Queens,_NY.jpg), for instance, is a pretty woodsy neighborhood with a really nice suburban area. Doesn't smell like shit. You just have to get out of Manhattan.

&gt; It's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.

I'll admit, NYC can feel a bit crowded when you're on a packed train trying to commute to work, but otherwise, I've not experienced having to wade through crowds of people on a regular basis. And if I do, I wouldn't call the typical New York resident a member of ""drab, disheveled humanity"". In fact, some of us are quite good-looking and take pride in our hygiene. 

&gt; The cost of living is exorbitant.

Salaries are adjusted to the cost of living, to some small degree. But you're probably still thinking of Manhattan (and some trendy parts of Brooklyn). When you go out into the outer boroughs, rent can easily go down to 700/600/500 per month, which isn't terrible. When you weigh the cost of living in a small space to the availability of basically everything (i.e. food, nightlife, cultural institutions, people, schools, etc.), then I would say lots of people would give up a front yard to live in a place of diversity and activity.

&gt; Winters are frigid and soul-crushing.

This is undeniably true. [But hey, at least we're not Boston, whose largest snow pile just melted yesterday.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/14/422939198/the-last-boston-snow-farm-finally-melts)","Brooklyn resident here. Moved in a few months ago from a small CT town and would like to provide my input as I have fallen in love with my City and Neighborhood. 

Your first point, ""It's filthy and old and in disrepair.""  Since you don't live here you may not understand that many of the buildings that look like they're in disrepair are actually some of the most hip and interesting places. For example, My office building is an old Brass Factory in Williamsburg Brooklyn and from the outside it kinda looks abandoned, but walk in and you'll see that it has a very aesthetically pleasing interior. Don't judge a book by its cover. On top of that, yes NYC is an old city, therefor it has a rich history resulting in an overwhelming appreciation and desire for vintage styles/fashion/lifestyles/art/etc.. That's why I believe Brooklyn and other parts of NYC have been deemed a Hipster hub. Old, doesn't always mean bad. For the trash, yes, there are parts that are more dirty than others, but much of the city is really clean too. I think your experience with the trash might be a bit narrow minded.  

It's crowded. Yes, yes it is and thats a beautiful thing. I always get an appreciating for the human race when I'm walking through a sea of people because it's an achievement to be able to sustain so many people in such a small area. Also, those Disheveled/drab people are also some of the smartest and most innovative people in the nation.  On top of that NYC is probably one of the most diverse and ethnically accepting cities in the world. With all these people comes exposure to new cultures, rituals, food, outlooks on life, etc. 

Cost of living is high and salaries reflect that. The average salary for a particular job in NYC is higher than other places. Rent is so expensive, but you're not paying so much to sleep in a small apartment but rather paying to be so close to all the action. There is so much to experience that if you're staying in Mon-Fri, you're not doing NYC right. 

Climate. Boston just had record snow falls and a much harsher winter than us. The heat, just comes with the north east. In the summer, it's always humid and hot. That's not just for NYC, thats everywhere. The smell of garbage can be a problem and it's most prevalent in the subway systems, where it can get uncomfortably hot, but this is mostly in the touristy areas of the city where non-residents think it's ok to liter. I've seen tourists litter waaaaayyyyy more often than residents who have an appreciation for their city. 

It seems like you're mostly describing parts of Manhattan. I invite you to come to my Neighborhood in Brooklyn. PM me when you're in the city next and I'll treat you to an immaculate cuisine and unforgettable night that you'll only be able to experience here.

"Do you believe extinction is better than existence in captivity? If so I doubt I can help but if not please read on. 

Because existence in captivity is certainly capable of providing more for an animal than the wild.  Stored food for the winter,  provided water and medical treatment, protection from predators.  And a swift death when the time comes.

The more considerate ones that *didn't* twist around your words in their head are giving solid advice. The advice sucks, the world sucks, the whole situation sucks (you can tell I've been there), but a lot of the advice in this thread is legitimately worth trying. Why? Because it gives you a list of objectives to achieve (things to try), and you can gamify that list. Some of the stuff on the list is going to turn out more fun than you anticipated. 

There's a lot I could say about what would be some of your best courses of action going forward, but I think that's better discussed in a different context and environment. If you want to talk about that, hit me up in PM. I've been there. 

Now, regarding this CMV. Long post ahead. In fact, I had to cut it up in multiple posts, because I hit the limit.

The topic, explicitly, says that you think gifted children should receive *more* attention *than* special needs children. Intuitively, this sounds true from an economy perspective: if two hours of attention per week boosts future productivity by 1%, wouldn't putting this on gifted children -- which have a higher base productivity rate, goes the assumption -- make much more economic sense than putting it on those who have the *lowest* base productivity rate? What gives? 

However, the numerical reality is much more interconnected with other aspects of our society. Normally, at this point (at least IME), things diverge into how things are too complex or complicated for you, or if you're so smart why don't you understand this already, or a bunch of things that are basically ways of not saying that they consider you unworthy of their time since you're just a child, and children just don't understand obvious things, that's what they do in life. 

You could, yes, do all of the research and study and analysis yourself, but you've got tons and tons and tons of things like this that you want to devote time and energy to, and like everyone else you often fall prey to your own [akrasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia), or slam yourself against a perpetually insufficient amount of daily [mental energy](http://lifehacker.com/5798202/the-cognitive-cost-of-doing-things). That's why you came here, right? 

With that long preamble out of the way, let's look at the details. The first thing that is considered (and, we'll see later, *with good reason*) is the process of **Identification**. The System (the interoperating amalgam of the influences of teachers on the field, numerical test results, general testing strategies, schedules, etc.) must first identify gifted students in order to do anything about them. Makes sense, and seems simple enough. Plug in the big picture: The System must routinely, collectively, as a cooperative force, accurately test and evaluate *hundreds of thousands* of children, one to three times per year, to grade them on dozens of different scales and classify them according to at least 16 completely different categories of nonstandard-ness (not sure how many types of special-needs students are recognized, but I see at least 13 [here](http://www.bctf.ca/uploadedfiles/public/publications/2012edfacts.pdf) and the letter ""P"" hints at more). And note that I've said *accurately*. A given test designed so that anyone with a score of over x on the test is found to be a ""gifted"" child might have a 50% detection rate and a 15% false positive rate. The real numbers here will depend on the specific method being evaluated, and are probably locked up in some office over at the ministry of education somewhere. 

Giftedness detection rate will be naturally lower than for other special needs, and/or have naturally larger false positive rates, because the easier detection methods are much more prone to confounding broader or deeper knowledge with giftedness, which leads to false trails caused by variation in prior learning performance, the family income effects, the ""expert immersion"" effects (if the child being tested has a renowned scientist as a parent, who takes a lot of time to teach them, they could very easily test as ""gifted"" even when they don't qualify on the less-quantified aspects), and so on. Hearing disabilities are easy to identify, and it's pretty hard to get false positives. Language barriers are a bit easier to get false positives for, but those are fairly quickly sorted out when they happen. Most abnormality on the ""deficient"" side of the spectrum quickly jumps out with minimal testing (and minimal identification *costs*) because, one way or another, something is blocking the well-oiled educational machine and these children are just falling off the conveyor belt. Ever heard a child fall off a conveyor belt? They're noisy as hell, all that crying and-- where were we?

Right, so giftedness incurs a higher identification cost, and a lower detection accuracy for equivalent methods -- meaning either we're spending more money to get more accurate testing (or more redundancy), or we're spending money on gifted children but missing a bunch of them and also spending a ton of money on gifted education for children who aren't actually gifted. Granted, by the same conveyor belt logic, those non-gifted children will fall off the gifted track eventually and be caught cheaply and quickly -- but until then, that's extra funding and time and attention for them that wouldn't have been consumed had they stayed on the normal track. More costs! And we're still just in the Identification phase. [This paper](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ746292.pdf) has the most data on this specific topic that I've ever seen in a single place, and expresses well most of the difficulties. 

Next up you need to look at teacher attention and the overall costs of actually providing a separate educational program for gifted children. Even if that just meant ""give them twice as much homework"", there would be administrative costs associated with all the tracking of the students, handling their extra program requirements, and all the other behind-the-scenes stuff that goes on. As a whole, these costs are fairly similar to each other from category to category, in terms of special need category. What little data I've seen on this is rather mixed, so absent evidence otherwise let's assume for now that keeping track of the gifted program costs about as much time and attention as keeping track of the language barriers program, alright?

After that, you need to look at which kinds of programs to actually implement. This is a multivariable cost-benefit comparison. The cost of evaluating programs and field testing can be ignored relatively safely, as it's a one-off cost that pays for itself over the long term, presumably, and it's a cost that has also been paid many times over for evaluating programs for other tracks -- I'm sure that with the tools and experience we have today, it would cost a lot less time and funding to devise a good program than it did to come up with most of the special needs program currently in place today. 

1/2","I agree that giving the brightest more chances is a good idea. In particular, shoving them into a class with 30-35 people of mixed abilities is a bad idea. There should be some kind of tiered education, especially for maths. I'm surprised that Canada does not do that. You can't teach the highest level of mathematics to the less able students, which is why in the UK they separate you off above the ages of 14.

However, you are not as special as you think you are. In fact, probably labelling you as ""gifted"" has done more to damage your education than the lack of support for gifted children. It has made you think you are above your classmates and that school work is beneath you. It has made you stop trying. It has made you envious of what the special needs children have.

I was told I was gifted too. I got sent on special events for gifted children. I realise now that it didn't mean anything.

The argument you dismissed is actually correct. Special needs children and stupid children get special attention because if they didn't they would:

* disrupt lessons
* become unproductive members of society
* become a burden on society

They need the help to achieve what you could without effort. If you are indeed intelligent, then you don't need help. The really intelligent people do well even without trying. You should be getting straight As without much effort, because the information is just absorbed by you being there. If that isn't the case, then you aren't as intelligent as you think you are and you should put some effort in if you want to succeed.

Intelligent people end up fine. It gives you so many little advantages that you take for granted and don't even realise. You'll read faster. You'll remember things easier and with less effort. You'll make better decisions. You'll handle your finances better. You'll find it easier to delay gratification. You'll find it easier to know how to eat healthier, and to do it. You'll find it easier to find a high paying job, and to perform well at it, and to get promotions. You'll find it easier to learn new things and adapt (even little things, that you don't notice).

The point is, you could be completely neglected, and still succeed, because you were gifted one of the greatest things: a sharp mind. If you want to throw that away because you're jealous that kids who are probably going to have a pretty shitty life are being raised up, then you will regret it.

The options for intelligent people tend to open up more in later years of schooling. You are 13. Up until now, you've probably been in the same lessons as everyone else. Over the next five years is when students begin to differentiate more, ultimately building to the most able going to the best universities, where they will have even more opportunities to excel and show themselves better than their peers. You don't need your hand holding to do this. Put the extra work in yourself. Learn. Expand your brain while it's still developing.

"Let me start by saying I tip well even when ordering at a counter.

i somewhat agree with you But if it is based on time and I buy a beer and pay with exact cash shouldn't I be paying next to nothing? 

At a restaurant you are tipping a waiter, bus boys, cooks, and hosts. The reason it works is at nicer restaurants there are more employees doing the same job. You pay more for your meal and your higher tip goes to more people. 

Obviously the best case scenario would be to just have a livable wage. 

Here is an interesting thought though. In cities that are raising their minimum wages to $15 an hour am I still going to be expected to tip well? It seems to be that food service employees are going to be ridiculously well compensated for a job that takes no skills. Especially in San Fransisco where restaurants are required to also provide health care for their employees.

","I am of two minds about tipping. On the one hand, it's getting very confusing with different people wanting tips, mainly because no one can live on minimum wage, and there being different rates depending on the work they do. On the other hand, I've traveled to places that didn't have tipping, and the service is not nearly as good. So I think tipping encourages good service, because the reward is immediate.

However, if we have tipping, I don't think it's unfair to base the amount on the total cost of the meal. High-end restaurants with high-end prices tend to hire for quality far more than low-end restaurants do. So in the server business, you start at a cheap chain restaurant and work your way up. By the time you get to the higher end restaurants, service is a high priority. Part of the service is that you are invisible but provide for the diner's needs without being intrusive. Therefore, you don't need to be particularly attractive, or young. You need to look well groomed, and keep your hair under control for health department reasons. But you don't have to be beautiful or handsome. You have to be good.

Also, waiters at really high-end restaurants do not have four or five tables to serve at one time. They have one or two.They will stand somewhere that you won't notice them and watch, so they can be there exactly when you want them, and even before you realize you want something, and they already have it. So they have to make more money per table to make it worth it. They are not running around as much as the waiter at Chili's, but they are exercising skill as they anticipate needs. And if there were no tipping, you could rest assured that the high-end restaurants would pay their wait staff more so that they could get the best. And you would pay them more in your bill.

Despite its flaws, the current system does account for skill and level of attention. The no-tip system, in my experience, results in lesser levels of service, but would mean that better waiters got paid better at restaurants that demand a higher level of service. A flat-rate or time-based system like you propose would be more complicated than a no-tip system and still not account for the differences between having to flag your waiter down at Chili's to ask for more ketchup and having your needs anticipated at a high-end restaurant. ",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a detailed explanation of how tipping encourages good service, particularly in high-end restaurants where wait staff provide a higher level of service that is not intrusive but anticipates the needs of the diners. The response also addresses the idea that without tipping, high-end restaurants would likely pay their wait staff more to attract the best talent, ultimately resulting in a higher bill for the customer. This detailed explanation of the benefits of tipping in different restaurant settings and the potential consequences of eliminating tipping altogether is likely more persuasive in changing the OP's view on tipping.",0
"As someone who flies quiet frequently, I used to agree with you, but now I know you are simply wrong. I used to sit there and laugh at all the people queuing up a half hour before the plane was scheduled to start boarding. I'd wait until I was the last possible person and then stroll onto the plane like I was smarter than every person who had stood around waiting. 

If you care about getting an overhead compartment for your carry-on luggage, you'd better hope you are boarding early. Any sold out flight is going to run out of room in the overhead compartments long before everyone is on the plane (doesn't matter how large the plane is--this has been true for me for domestic and international flights, from puddle-jumpers, to Airbus A380). There is nothing in the world worse than landing at 2AM after a 5 hour, cross-country flight and having to wait an hour for your bag to arrive at baggage claim. I cringe at the announcement that the flight is sold out and some passengers *may volunteer* to check their carry-on item to their final destination.

If you do not care about the overhead bin, then you are a minority, and you're right that there is no rush to get onto the plane. 

But your statement that ""Lining up to get on an airplane is pointless."" is entirely false because there definitely is a very good point (in fact, other people on the thread have had other great reasons which I didn't consider because I usually take flights where seats aren't first-come-first-serve).

It's not like ""oh, I apologize too much, I gotta remind myself not to apologize as frequently"" habit. It's a thing your brain thinks you **need** and will respond as though something has gone very drastically if it thinks its not getting the thing it needs.","There are a few issues here. Firstly there are two main kinds of addiction, psychological and physiological. Psychological addiction is the brain saying ""dude you need this, go get it"", a little like an incredibly strong habit. People with a psychological addiction may suffer withdrawal symptoms, but they are purely psychosomatic. Physiological addiction however is different. It will only occur with certain substances, but once the physiological addiction sets in the body quickly becomes dependant upon the substance, no longer able to function properly without it. Take away the substance and the withdrawal is pretty horrific, seizures, blacking out, sometimes comas or even death in extreme cases.

In both cases once the addiction has set in it is at best difficult and at worst impossible to break the addiction without medical treatment. To call it a disease is a misnomer, but to call it a habit is even less accurate.

As for your first sentence, I consider it wrong on both counts. Firstly because most diseases do disappear quickly with no apparent reason, the person just got better. Secondly (depending on where we draw the line of what is and isn't addiction) breaking an addiction generally requires some form of treatment, albeit not treatment in the same sense that most see it but something more akin to many treatments for mental health issues, though strong physiological addictions do often require drugs and other medical attention.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of the differences between psychological and physiological addiction, as well as the challenges of breaking an addiction.

"&gt; "" as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea"" 

If you want to be you can get a copy of his plea agreement as all agreements for felonies must be submitted in writing to the Circuit Court.  You can contact the Charlottesville Circuit Court Clerk [here](http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/circuit/charlottesville/home.html). Now he didn't get away with serving 3 months of an 8 year sentence he was literally sentenced to 8 years with all but 3 months suspended.  In other words the judge sentenced him to a three month active sentence and can revoke the suspended period should he commit another violation during his period of good behavior.

&gt; he is not considered a threat to the public

He is a violent sex offender.  He has to let the police know where he lives and works at all times so they can keep tabs on him.  He is visited at a minimum of once a year by a State Police officer who verifies this information through a surprise visit.  In addition he must provide the police any and all usernames on social media, email addresses, vehicles he regularly uses, and his dna.  [See Va Code 9.1-903](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title9.1/chapter9/section9.1-903/)

He wasn't convicted of rape he had the charge reduced to aggravated sexual battery under Va Code 18.2-67.3 from rape.  You can find it by looking him up [here in the Charlottesville Circuit Court](http://ewsocis1.courts.state.va.us/CJISWeb/MainMenu.do).  While the charge was reduced from rape the statement of facts which he admitted was accurate as part of his plea agreement states that he anally and vaginally raped a girl.  You can get that from the clerk's office as it was made part of the record.

Edit: spelling","&gt;Edit: If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape, I will award you a delta.

I'm not sure if this is enough, but you can read a report on it [here](http://www.readthehook.com/95057/news-uva-rape-case-student-accepts-lesser-charge). He was charged with rape and plead to aggravated sexual battery (according to [this](http://www.wm.edu/offices/police/sexualassault/laws/) the difference is vaginal penetration, though I couldn't find that in the statutes specifically). He plead guilty to aggravated sexual battery because a rape conviction has a 5 year minimum sentence and that charge was dropped because of the plea, not because of the specific facts at hand.

This would be in line with the tweet:

&gt;""""Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal.""

It doesn't say *convicted* rapist, it says *literal* rapist. I can't see anything where he argues he didn't have sex with her, just that it was consensual and/or the alcohol's fault. The aggravated sexual battery charge alone would match other state's as well as some people's colloquial definition of ""rape."" If this was nonconsensual (as he plead guilty to) and involved penetration then it would indeed be rape, and the lesser charge would be an artifact of the plea  bargaining system (as the person mentions).

"&gt;There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber.

Right, there shouldn't be. There are some places where Uber is lobbying to get itself exempted from existing regulations, and that's wrong.

But I think pretty much everyone agrees with you there. The question is what should happen in the cities where, due to old or poorly drafted laws, Uber isn't covered in the first place. Is it really their responsibility to follow the regulations anyway? Shouldn't the government have the responsibility to write fair laws?","&gt;My argument is that, whatever the level of regulation you favor, Uber and yellow/green cabs should be held to the same standard.

They don't provide the same service, so the same regulations are not applicable. No street-hail is the biggest difference. Uber already does background checks, etc., and they are very strict about banning drivers for bad behavior. Can you provide evidence that cabs are better or safer in any way vis-a-vis specific rules that they have to follow, while Uber drivers are ""getting away with"" skirting those rules?

They recognized an inefficiency in the market as it relates to taxi licensing and took advantage of that by offering a similar service that avoids those issues. About that part you are totally right. And for all the years and years of people trying to ""use the political process"" to get those inefficient laws changed changed with no success, within just a couple of years things are closer to changing than they ever would have been otherwise. There is no reason why they should have to handicap themselves by following laws that don't apply to them just because their service is similar to that of a taxi. ",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced argument by pointing out the specific differences between Uber and traditional cabs, such as the lack of street-hail and the different safety measures in place. It also addresses the issue of inefficiencies in the market and how Uber has been able to address them. This response directly challenges the OP's view by providing evidence and reasoning to support the idea that Uber should not necessarily be held to the same standards as traditional cabs.",0
"This slogan is for people who do not seem to have the IQ or common sense to take basic precautions for their own safety. There are two ways to convince these prospective candidates of the Darwin award - authority or emotion. Appeal to emotion requires some introspection and determining your own worth to your family etc. This is intellectually more involved than common sense and thus clearly beyond the capabilities of these individuals. Therefore, an appeal to authority, like law, is your only chance.","I agree that it is an appeal to authority.  I still think it is a good slogan, because many people are have either pre-conventional (how do I avoid punishment) or conventional (what does the law state) morality.

"Registering someone doesn't ""make"" them go to the polls and vote, it merely preserves that ability to do so if they find that they want to at the last minute.

And that's a valuable purpose. The main purpose of democracy is not to represent all the views of all the people all the time, it's to act as a check and balance on oppression and extremely bad government. 

This goal is frustrated any time there are artificial barriers in the way of people voting when they feel the need/desire to do so. Registration is exactly that kind of arbitrary artificial barrier.

As such, it tends to frustrate the actual primary purpose of democracy: people being able to object when the government does things they don't like. ","For a lot of the people I've asked why they don't vote, they give one of two main answers ""I don't know how/I don't have the time!"" or ""Why should politics matter to me?

"To the extent that municipalities may ignore it and have their own rules, sure.

I'm a big supporter of this, but I'm realistic enough to know that it won't work everywhere. Just as there are places you can't go right on red, this also needs to be barred at plenty of specific intersections.

More to the point, though, anything like this must be joined with adequate public education. I also favour things like lane-splitting by motorcyclists, and I'm fine with two-wheelers (judiciously) threading through stopped or very slow traffic, and passing on the right. But it's got to be done in a way that doesn't lead to the kind of foaming and spitting rage we see in threads like this.
","I am against this idea for any number of reasons. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to change your mind, since you don't seem to be open-minded in your responses. However... 

First, what is the goal of this? If the goal is 100% cyclist safety, that would mean an outright ban on all cars. Obviously, not going to happen. So we've already ruled out cyclist safety as an absolute goal. 

If the goal is throughput, there would be no intersections at all -- just on and off ramps based on where you want to go. So throughput also can't be an absolute goal. 

So what we're trying to do is balance safety and throughput. First, you are comparing Idaho to major metropolitan cities. I know you've stated a couple times now that density has nothing to do with it, but I believe you are 100% wrong. Density absolutely has a lot to do with it. It's different riding a bike on a 2-lane road vs a 12-lane road. It's self-evident that crossing 5 lanes of traffic to make a left turn is  harder than not crossing any. I dare you to try riding your bike in NYC the same way you do in Boise. 

So given this current understanding, your argument boils down the same (tired) arguments from cyclists: 

1. Lane jumping (moving to the front) makes it safer.
2. Traffic laws weren't meant for cyclists, but for big heavy cars.
3. Cyclists are more maneuverable and can respond quicker. 

This argument has been rehashed several times. I don't see anybody giving way. 

1. Based on my anecdotal evidence, lane jumping makes everyone a lot more pissy, and dramatically increases congestion because most cyclists cannot keep up at 30mph (the speed limit for a city arterial, unless otherwise posted). So we all get past this cyclist, then he gets to the front of the line and we have to do it all over again. All this does is encourage drivers to pass the cyclist more aggressively (3 feet zero point zero inches), decreasing safety. 
2. While traffic laws weren't designed with bikes in mind, the #1 factor in safety is consistency. If everybody is going 30mph or 70mph, it's the consistency that keeps everyone safe. It's only when somebody is trying to go 90 in a 70, weaving around, that trouble happens. So while it may not be the best rules, knowing how cyclists will act makes it a lot safer to drive around them. If I have to worry about some cyclist just cutting over randomly because they want to ride in the road, it's significantly more dangerous. In addition, riding on the right-side of the road in the path of a car trying to make a right turn is a recipe for disaster. If the cyclist just stopped and waited their turn, no safety issue. 
3. This is irrelevant, see point #2. 

I'm all for separate bike infrastructure and cycle tracks to make commuting easier, but I end up resenting it when I see cyclists acting like a-holes on streets they're supposed to share. The joke here is that sharing, to a cyclist, means that nobody gets in their way whatsoever. 

",1,2,False,"Response 2 presents a well-thought-out argument that addresses the goals of the proposed idea, the impact of density on cycling safety, and provides specific examples to support the argument against allowing cyclists to jump lanes. The response also highlights the importance of consistency in traffic laws for overall safety. On the other hand, Response 1 mainly focuses on the need for public education and the potential implementation challenges without directly addressing the concerns raised in the original post.",0
"A lot of your arguments boil down to opinions, which you can't really change by stating facts. You may not think Chrome looks good, but others would say that it does. It really comes down to personal taste.

You also have to give Chrome a lot of credit for pushing the state-of-the-art in Web and Web browser development. Before Chrome came out in 2008, the Web was an incredibly difficult platform to develop on. A majority of the Web's users used various forms of Internet Explorer, with a much smaller population using Firefox. And even as far as browser design was considered, it was All Toolbars, All The Time (modeled after IE6).

Chrome really shook up browser design, in a very big way. With tabs in the window header, people had a LOT more vertical viewing room, which made browsing the Web better. Along with browsing, having better support for new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features allowed developers to build beautiful, performant websites without using external plugins (like Flash and Java). This gave way to Responsive Web Design, allowing pages to look good no matter what device the user is browsing with.

Finally, on the subject of memory use, Chrome is a hog for a reason: security. Chrome was the first browser to have Tab Sandboxing, which means that each browser tab spawns its own operating system process. Should the tab crash for some reason (Flash fails to load, page can't be reached on the server, etc), it won't bring down the entire browser. Also, code running in one tab can't access the data in another tab; they're accessing entirely different sections of memory. That all comes at a cost, however: with more tabs open and more processes running, more memory is being used. That's less of a concern now since users are commonly using machines with 4+ GB of RAM, but it can still bog down the rest of the machine since the OS has to page memory in and out of disk swap (but now I'm getting far too technical). Extensions as well also operate in their own process, so the more extensions you have installed, the more memory you're using.

As I said in the first paragraph, I don't expect this explanation will change your mind. However, it's important to know the design decisions the Chrome dev team made, and how it impacted the rest of the Web. Most other browsers look/operate like Chrome because Chrome pioneered a far superior way of doing things, and other browser vendors followed suit. I've only scratched the surface of what Chrome has done (their v8 JavaScript VM, WebRTC, SPDY/HTTP 2.0, rapid development cycle, WebM, etc etc etc). Point being, Chrome is very much on the forefront of Web and browser development. Google employs a LOT of brilliant people to work on this product, and it shows. Just because the browser's design has stabilized isn't a sign that it's slowing down; rather it's a sign that others are catching up.","One thing that seems outright ignored here:

&gt; Saying that you use Chrome means nothing anymore, and might as well use IE (or the incarnation Spartan)

If you mean it's unremarkable because Chrome is so popular, is that a bad thing? Plus, Chrome is mostly Chromium, which is open source. There is no version of IE which can say that, and if IE and Chrome were in all other ways equal, I'd choose the one that's more open.

&gt; Edit: Also the memory usage by Chrome is crazy. I can't comment on the memory usage by Firefox haven't used it that much

I agree that Chrome needs to improve memory usage, but I don't think you're doing a fair comparison. Not entirely your fault, because it's *hard* to do a fair comparison. You'd basically need to import all your bookmarks and history and such back into Firefox, find Firefox equivalents for all your Chrome extensions, open the same webpages in the same order, and so on...

Even then, you'd need to use Chrome's task manager to measure how much memory it's using, because the Windows Task Manager (or the OS X Activity Monitor, or just 'top 'on Linux) often massively overestimates it. Like the top poster says, Chrome has this multiprocess model. Those processes still share a lot of memory, so the OS is double-counting that. (Or triple, or quadruple...)

At the end of the day, I think Firefox still wins. But it's not as insane a difference as people think. I think probably half the reason people think Chrome RAM is ridiculous is that it's the browser they're using.

That said, I agree with at least some of the sentiment here -- I miss the days when Chrome was so obviously faster than everything else that Google was [showing off like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCgQDjiotG0).

And yet, with *that* said:

&gt; To put it simply, other browsers has closed, if not overtaken the Chrome and everything it stood for.

To an extent, this is true. It certainly happened pretty quickly for JavaScript, for example -- everyone was using pretty naive JS *interpreters* back then, and Chrome was the first browser to do an actual JIT VM, compiling JS down to native code. It was like five to ten times faster than every other browser. Safari and IE closed that gap pretty quickly.

But I think this is most of what Chrome was meant for anyway. Why did Google make a browser? To push the Web forward. Sounds altruistic, but it's simpler than that -- they want things like Gmail to be fast. Most users used IE, and IE is slow, so Gmail was (relatively) slow for a lot of users.

I think it's fair to say that Chrome fixed that problem. Chrome made JS fast enough in Chrome to embarrass all the other browsers into making their own JS engines fast. So now Gmail is fast, even in IE. Even if 90% of users were still stuck on IE, that would be a win.

From that perspective, the fact that Chrome also has a lot of users is just a nice side effect. (And it's also insurance that Microsoft will never again do what they did with IE6.)",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed explanation of the design decisions and innovations made by Chrome, such as tab sandboxing and support for new web technologies. This response also addresses the issue of memory usage in a technical manner, explaining the trade-offs for security. By providing this information, Response 2 gives a more comprehensive view of why Chrome is considered a leader in web development, which could potentially change the OP's perspective.",0
"I don't see how you focusing on the marriage aspect fits with your stated fears. Gay people are already freely and openly having sex in Western society; that ship has sailed long ago. America finally allowing gay couples to get married doesn't really change that. Along those lines, whether a gay couple is officially married doesn't change whether they can bear a child in the traditional manner. Marriage is pretty irrelevant to your concerns.

One of the worries you list is that society will become inordinately focused on catering to every form of sexuality. But actually, accepting that homosexuality is not a big boogey-man means we can stop putting so much focus on it. Instead we can all go on with our lives. That's the opposite of having this inordinate focus on the issue.

&gt; any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.

You're talking specifically about the laws and legal decisions of one specific court in one specific country in one tiny moment in history. Nature, and specifically human nature, existed long before the supreme court did, or before the concept of legal state-sponsored marriage. So did homosexuality.","&gt;One of the main arguments against gay marriage is that it is ""unnatural"". One could also argue that incest and pedophilia are unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.

Marriage is unnatural, humans present both monogamous and polygamous behaviour, marriage is outrageous and against nature.

&gt;Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage. The term progressive is very open for interpretation, but eliminating discrimination is very straight forward. If someone named Cercei loves her brother named Jamie, should it be allowed? Should they be allowed to marry and procreate? Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality.

Nope if they want to love each other or have sex that's fine, but having children should be illegal in some way.

&gt;Should pedophilia be legalized on the basis of ""eliminating discrimination""

Pedophilia is almost indistinguishable from child abuse, and thus no, homosexuality is, just like heterosexuality, pretty darn distinguishable from rape, and thus they're both ok.

&gt;Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child.

Having children via incest should be illegal, homosexuality is a thing, and preventing gay people from marrying isn't going to make them straight all of a sudden, and one way of the other, the world is insanely overpopulated, and thus the less people that are born the better, the world would become a great place if suddenly everyone became homosexual, since natality would fall into nothingness and population would readjust somewhere reasonable.",2,2,True,"Response 2 addresses the OP's concerns more directly and logically. It points out that legalizing gay marriage doesn't change the fact that gay people are already engaging in relationships and that marriage itself is not directly related to the ability to procreate. It also argues that accepting homosexuality can actually reduce the focus on it in society, rather than increasing it.",0
"The White Stripes/Jack White had almost single-handedly brought blues music back to young people in the early 00s. Not to mention he was basically the first and only one to successfully combine punk and blues on a massive scale with songs like seven nation army and icky thump.

- therefore we should watch ISIS execution videos

However, if that were the case, I don't think that ISIS would have uploaded the videos at all. Why would it try to generate so much publicity if it had such negative consequences (for ISIS)?

I think these videos are uploaded because the more publicity ISIS gets, the more people it recruits. Not only that, but the more people that are outraged about ISIS, the more countries will pay ransom for hostages, and more funding for ISIS. People also (needlessly, in my view) vote more militarily oriented governments in under the threat of terrorism, and they act irrationally on that basis, by signing away their rights (as you can see from recent politics) etc.

As well as the above, most people that do watch these videos do so of morbid curiosity, or will find some pleasure in watching someone being executed, however much they try not to. I don't think cultivating these experiences will make things any better.

You haven't accounted for the variety of reasons that lead to divorce. If one member leaves a marriage because their partner is abusive or violent, then it isn't an amicable or dispassionate end to the relationship. Don't you think that it's right for the victim to ask for any compensation?","There are many marriages where one spouse has given up his or her career to take care of children. In case of a divorce this person is now at a tremendous financial disadvantage because re-entering the workforce after several years can be difficult. Do you think it would be unfair if you were caught in such a situation without marketable skills?

Also let's say a couple has joint finances and are both working. Should the spouse pursuing the divorce not be entitled to his or her share of the money in the finances?

Additionally, decisions regarding custody of children can be difficult as well and can be considered punitive by some in the divorce process. An even split of custody isn't always a good outcome if one spouse is abusive. If one spouse intends to move, this would put unnecessary strain on children. All of these factors need to be considered in some way.

Ultimately, without such measures in divorce proceedings, a stay at home parent is at a disadvantage and financially will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce. This allows the other spouse to act in any manner he wishes, knowing his spouse will not leave him without great difficulty. Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children.

If so, then this will simply be a debate of semantics.","You should read [A Universe from Nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Universe_from_Nothing) by Lawrence Krauss.

Now about your CMV:

&gt; I tend to think, though, that some force or entity had to be the catalyst that caused the event.

What created this force or entity, in your opinion?

And, 

&gt; some extra-dimensional force or entity from another universe would have had to insert itself into ours, which sparked the event known as the Big Bang.

What makes you think this? Isn't the simple answer that we don't know everything about the Big Bang preferable to wild guesses?",2,2,True,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it addresses the OP's definition of ""God"" and how it aligns with the concept of an entity or energy beyond comprehension. It also challenges the OP to consider if their view is based on semantics or if it can be changed based on different perspectives.",0
"&gt;I don't see any good at all from keeping them around

Determining the value of one human being over another is an inherently sticky problem, especially if you're bringing in the idea of getting rid of those who aren't ""valuable enough"". There are always those who will see particular groups of people as ""less than"" those around them. So who should be granted that wonderful task of determining such a thing? You? What makes you more qualified than others to determine the worth of another person's life, especially if you're not even the one responsible for taking care of it?

What if those in charge of making such decisions started doing so on the basis of race? What about eliminating people who practice particular religions? Sometimes the reason not to do something (like eliminating inconvenient groups of people) isn't because it adds a direct benefit to society to keep them, but because to engage in such an act would make that society less worth living in (because of who that society would require us to be in order to be a part of it).

Your dislike of those who are mentally handicapped is subjective, as are the other examples mentioned here. If I have someone in my family who is mentally handicapped, but feel as though his or her presence adds to the overall quality of our life experiences, who are you to tell us that this family member isn't contributing to our overall well-being? Who are you to decide that this family member of mine should be eliminated simply because it makes you uncomfortable?

Sometimes the act of living in society is itself a social commitment to one another, that in times when we are not at our best requires the people as a whole to maintain an obligation to one another that says we will help to take up the slack in times when we the individual may not always be able to carry the load. It's this social contract to one another that allows us to have a certain level of existential anxiety relieved, because even if we are struggling ourselves, we know that our friends, our family, and sometimes even the society as a whole will help us through. While it's fine to condemn others and say ""but I've never needed such services or support from others"", this doesn't mean that you or those you love never will.","I totally get where you are coming from.

I had a job between jobs that was basically acting as a chaperone/aide taking adults with disabilities to socialize, go to classes and volunteer around the city.

Yes, I saw how tired their family must be and I'm pretty sure that  I dont want to raise a child with a disability. I'm selfish, but at the same time you never know how you will act until you are facing the problem.

During the time I spent with these people, I got to know them and become friends with some. They are just like us deep down and they want the same things. They are capable of learning, adapting and have wants and needs. 

Lumping them all into one giant entity is wrong. The range of ability between individual is different. I knew people who could navigate the city on their own and more or less live independently. They are able to work, read, write, make friends, have boyfriends/girlfriends, get married (and they do!). They have senses of humor and are kind and want to help others. I really believe that deep down inside they have thoughts like you and me, but it just gets lost somewhere along the way when they try to communicate.

Yes, they are a ""drain on society"", but so are a lot of able people.

"People keep responding with ""heterosexuality lets you pass on your genes, so it's better.""  This is in great contrast to the more fundamental principle of the selfish gene as outlined by Richard Dawkins.  You are not what natural selection cares about: only genes are.  If a gene is reproduced, it is successful, regardless of whether or not individual carriers of the gene reproduce.

This explains why homosexuality is prevalent in animals.  Sure, a homosexual organism may not *personally* reproduce, but genes which contribute to that behavior may be distributed in a great many other organisms.  Most likely, those closely related to the homosexual one.  This means that a combination of genes which produce homosexual organisms with a reasonable frequency give us a collection of related organisms, in which some do not personally reproduce.  This is theorized to result in additional caretakers, improving the survivability of that *cluster* of organisms which mostly carry the genes responsible.

So natural selection can absolutely favor ""gay genes""--you just won't find a stable population in which *all* organisms are gay (for obvious reasons).  But it seems that, for many social species, having these genes in the pool is better than not having them.  I.e., they are not actually selected against.

But you may have noticed a key point here.  Although genes which contribute to homosexuality (in combination, or with certain environmental factors, etc.) may be well distributed throughout the population, the system appears to work best when the number of dedicated homosexual organisms is a minor fraction.  To phrase it in inexact terms, about ""one per family"".

As a result, the most stable and successful population has homosexuality in the minority.  It is very important to understand that this does not make it bad, and in fact this appears to be better for survival of the collective gene pool than having no homosexuality.  So it's not weird, it's not ""selected against"", it's not an aberration, but it *is* a minority expression.  That's its optimum distribution.

I would shy away from using the word ""normal"", which has a lot of connotative baggage, and go with the word ""typical"".  Heterosexuality in humans is typical, homosexuality considerably less so, and both contribute to our collective survival.  As we run up to a lot of population walls, and the population plateaus, the equation will change.  At that point (and perhaps we're already getting there), the optimum distribution of homosexuality may be higher.

Aside from all that, there's the matter of bisexuality.  Genetics and behavior are very complex, but when you consider the idea that there are various contributing genes which affect us in different circumstances to, in general, provide a baseline level of homosexuality in the population, it's understandable that many other people may *partially* express that orientation.  Certain aspects of homosexuality can coexist with heterosexual behavior, and so we have bisexuality.  Nevertheless, it seems that statistically the heterosexual behavior must be more common in the population for optimum performance.  So despite bisexual tendencies, heterosexuality is still typical, and more often expressed in individuals with some bisexual behavior than homosexuality is.

You could argue that someone who's even a *little* bit bisexual no longer counts as ""straight"", but if pretty much their entire history of relationships and actual sexual activity is straight, and they just happen to enjoy gay porn sometimes, I think it's reasonable to call them functionally straight.  If we divide bisexuality into ""mostly straight"" and ""mostly gay"", you'll see that straight+mostly straight is much more common than gay+mostly gay.

And beyond all that, you propose that ""most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there.""  Well, sure, but you have to realize that we're dealing with a gradient and not three distinct buckets.  We don't start in one bucket and then choose another later.  We have a complex and sprawling map of behaviors.  Our genetics contribute to which paths we take.  It appears that the most typical situation is that people stick to heterosexuality in most circumstances, even if certain circumstances would result in homo/bisexual behavior.  So straight is still typical, despite our potential gradient of behavior.","I think your title is a bit confusing. What you are asking it seems is if there's a genetic determination for heterosexuality. 

One way to answer this question is to look at twins, because they have the same genome, but can have different environment if they are raised separately, they allow to distinguish between genetic and environmental effects with a bit of math. It seems people found a bit of genetic determination for sexual preference.

Another way it just to sequence the genome of a large number of people, and to ask them their sexual preference. If you have enough of these, and with a bit a of math, you can measure how much genetic factors determine a trait. It seems people have found genetic determinants of sexual preference, although the studies are still quite preliminary.

You can also look across different species, for example the genetic of sexual behavior of fruit flies is well understood. There's also some genes in mice that seems to control sexual preference.

Finally one can look across societies, both contemporary and in the past. If something, like sexual preference is conserved across all societies, it's a argument for a genetic basis of sexual preference, because it rules out other environmental factors. I'm not sure about the answer here, but it seems to me that most societies are mainly heterosexual.

Note that everything that touch reproduction is usually under strong selective pressure, because it affects fitness much more directly than other traits.

"Your first three bullets are correct, its only on the 4rth that you run into some issues.  

We won't all be dead.  Not even close.  We have modern technology, like GMOs and healthcare and pumping systems that make the challenges of climate change largely doable, for those with the money to afford them.

"My initial reaction to this was outright confusion, as both I, my wife, and most people I know have friends of the opposite gender and those relationships do not fit the conditions you've posited. However, simply saying that doesn't warrant much of an argument, does it? 

Then again, *your* conviction is based on exactly that same thing. Quite simply, you're taking your own limited, personal experience and using it to reach a conclusion about the rest of the world. Anecdote  shouldn't be much basis for such sweeping conclusions, but unfortunately, that's how most people tend to think.

So, if your conviction on this subject comes from the experience of one person, does my own experience, as one person, negate that? If we're being logical, it should. I suppose you could say that I am lying, or that I'm simply too naive to see that my relationships truly *do* fit into your characterization. However, those issues of veracity are frankly the only things that could logically diminish my account in the overall formulation of your conclusions here.

Furthermore, you've already admitted to having had a purely platonic male friend in the past. So, you know it is a possibility. However, you dismiss this as being an anomaly. Actually, after telling a story in which you confirm that these relationships *are* possible, you then immediately start to deny its  significance by saying, ""I think it MAY be possible"". Why, after you've already shown with an example that it in fact *is* possible, do you immediately introduce doubt by saying that it ""may"" be possible? Surely, you've already confirmed that it *is* possible. 

So, now your only remaining issue is one of frequency. From your own experience, the vast majority of these relationships don't work. In this thread, you have many people telling you from *their* own experience that many actually do. So, perhaps your issues of frequency are more unique to you than you think. 

Let's look at your anomaly: You wrote, "" I always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even...""
 
About the possibility of hooking up you wrote, ""but I would respect my relationship enough that I'm not really interested in doing that anyway"".

So, if we demonstrate mutual trust by introducing our significant others to our different-gendered friends, and we respect our significant others enough to ensure we would never do something to  hurt them, it seems to help. It's at least a very good start, right?

You also wrote, ""I also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me.

I'd say that certainly helps as well! I'm assuming there are plenty of  men in the world that you do not find sexually attractive, but also like their personalities. I'm also assuming that there are plenty of men out there who would feel the same about you. And, contrary to popular belief, even if you are a very attractive woman, not every man on earth is going to want to sleep with you. That being said, while a lack of sexual attraction helps, I don't think it's necessary at all. I think what is most necessary is trust and respect. 

The bottom line is, you know it can work. You can even point to specific things that seem to make it work. Those specific things you pointed to really aren't anomalous! It sounds like your experience has been limited and you are not forming the right kinds of male-female relationships. 

I'd like to add this as a more in-depth counter-anecdote: 

I have a few attractive female friends that are not my wife. They are intelligent, kind, interesting, and fun people who *happen* to be good-looking women. They are simply people who I enjoy spending time with. In a couple of instances, they are people that my wife has introduced me to. Friends of her own, who I've grown close to. My wife works crazy hours, and I've gone out with them alone for meals, movies, concerts, etc. I have felt none of these characteristics you are talking about. It's not an ego boost, and I have no ""just in case"" thinking. That last part was the most bizarre to me. The idea of losing my wife is far too devastating to start considering ""backup plans"". In terms of the ego boost, I'm not sure what you mean exactly. I mean, I'm certain that my female friends aren't hanging out with me because I look like Brad Pritt...primarily because I don't. And I'm not walking around with my chest puffed because of the ""hot chick"" that's by my side. We are hanging out because we think one another's an interesting, fun enough person to hang out with. That may give an ego boost, but just as much as a same-gendered friend would. We're being validated as people. Another human enjoys our company. Of course it feels nice. It needn't be about sex!

Anyways, I hope that with all the responses in this thread, at least someone will change your mind. Because, if not, you'll be losing nearly 50% of the population from your pool of potential friends! Friends are wonderful things, and they're not terribly easy to make and keep. Don't limit the possibilities.","If I understand you correctly, your view is that with a few exceptions, men always want sex from women and that women always want attention from men, and that while they can be friends, that friendship is incompatible with a relationship that either of the friends may be in.

It seems that your view is based solely in your own experiences, which in itself is not a bad thing, I think most people form their views in a similar fashion. The issue I have with this case is that, after having read responses to your view, and your responses to them, you don't seem willing to accept that anyone else's reasoning is as sound as your past experiences. Whenever someone makes an argument that your view is flawed, you respond with an exception, the issue is always that they have misunderstood you, not that you don't agree with their logic.

I have two points to make about this, the first is that it doesn't appear, to me, that you are willing to have your view changed. I think that you are certain that your experiences are characteristic of any interaction between any man and any woman. Which leads me to my second point, perhaps the relationships you base your view upon are flawed. If all of your male friends only want to sleep with you and have no other motives for being your friend then that  specific relationship is what is wrong, not every relationship between two platonic friends.

"You haven't said anything inaccurate but I think you're missing why your example is creepy.

It makes the other person think, ""why were they looking that far back in my profile"" or ""why do they remember that small detail"". It gives a slightly violated feel. As if your entire life was just examined and judged by someone. Social media is not a diary or a wikipedia about our lives. It's a way to stay in connect and ""speak"" to your friends instantly at any point in time. Before you mention that they shouldn't feel violated because they posted it, imagine someone listening to all of the things you've said publicly, on a recording device. Yes you said those things for the public to hear, but you don't enjoy the idea of somebody listening to all those things at once. When the youth post on social media, its like they are speaking casually to their friends. Internet based relationships are so imbedded in our lives that we don't give a second thought to the things we say online. So people can often times forget they even said the quote in question and it's off putting when someone brings up something you don't remember saying. People that ""stalk"" others profiles are also generally presented as creepy in TV/movies. When a person mentions a detail in someones Facebook history from a long time ago, it gives off a creeper vibe.

I've been told that the American Civil War was not really about slavery but about the degree of control that the Federal government wanted to put on the states, after a hundred years of minding their own business. The expectation of self-control was already baked in, so even a mind-bogglingly positive policy such as the abolition of slavery was the canary in the coal-mine. The states revolted and it got messy.

What's happening on reddit is at a microscopic level compared to the Civil War, but many of the same feelings are mixed in. It's just part of human nature, and that's why Pao's actions will be harmful: the implicit contract was broken, no matter how good the intentions for breaking it.","I don't know whether Ellen Pao will hurt the free speech on reddit.  But I don't think that talking about ""harassment"" is necessarily so harmless.  It reminds me of when Christina Hoff Sommers went to [Oberlin](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/22/christina-hoff-sommers-speaker-oberlin-triggers-de/?page=all), many of the protestors used language like harassment, safe space, triggering, etc to try and shut her down, when she was just giving an alternative point of view.  Another example is [this](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/5/8736591/liberal-professor-identity) story.  I have seen many others where people say that just promoting a certain political view is ""harassing"" some group.

Anyway, back to Pao...if you read [this](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/05/19/407971708/reddits-new-harassment-policy-aimed-at-creating-a-safe-platform) recent interview, she says:

&gt; It's not our site's goal to be a completely free-speech platform. We want to be a safe platform and we want to be a platform that also protects privacy at the same time.

And

&gt; We know we do have a problem of group harassment as well, but we're trying to address one problem at a time and we will get to group harassment next.

In response to a question about a group that ""would feel targeted by a whole thread of discussion?""  I think this ""group harassment"" idea is potentially a source of censorship.  If you look at almost any high-stakes political discussion, a group can ""feel targeted"" by it.  Israelis and Palestinians, people who've had abortions, Christians, etc.  I think it's very possible that certain groups would be ""protected"" from group harassment but not others.  So for example if someone criticizes MRAs that's just discussion, but if they criticize feminists that's targeting women. 

I don't know if that's what she thinks, but there are definitely people who would characterize attacks on feminism as ""targeting women"" (an example that comes to mind is [this](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/libe/dv/11_revframework_statute_/11_revframework_statute_en.pdf), the EU's (proposed but not passed) ""Model National Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance"".  It seeks to ban ""group libel"", which to me is similar to ""group harassment"".  It seeks to target - alongside racism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism - ""anti-feminism"").

EDIT: Also:

&gt; I don't think that reddit or any privately held corporation is under obligation to host anything of that nature.

That's true, but reddit is also not obligated to host Republicans, or religious people, or people opposed to more NASA funding.  I don't think their rights is the issue, it's the question of having a website that is run pursuant to principles that most people like, like the ideal of free speech.

"There was a CMV a couple of days ago that boiled down to ""Why do atheist people believe it is ok to go up to those who want to promote their religion [and challenge their views with an atheistic viewpoint]?"" and the answer to that question is literally ""Because I explicitly have the right to freedom of speech.""; If they'd asked the question differently, then we could've talked about the merits of religion vs the merits of atheism, but as the question stood, freedom of speech is what gives an atheist the right to go and challenge a theist who is proselytizing in the public space.

"I think the important thing here is *why* she won the suit.    
   
The jury never found that McDonald's was entirely responsible.   
The award was given to the plaintiff based on the principle of 'Comparative Negligence'. This principle isn't applied in all jurisdictions, but it *is* used in the jurisdiction wherein the incident and the lawsuit took place.   
According to this doctrine the plaintiff can be awarded damages even if they themselves contributed to the damage.

"The North winning is by far the best scenario for the vietnam war. 

The reason for this is because you fail to factor in China. China was ballsy enough to invade an independent Vietnam that was allied with the USSR after the war. You would be crazy to think that they would allow a territoy close to their South to fall to another enemy. 

If the South started winning and legitimately invaded the North, China would most likely allow North Vietnam's leadership to die off and they would install their own leaders and probably destroy the South.

The Vietnam war had relatively low casualties for the US side(even so there were protests around the US with millions of people yelling for peace), increasing that by a factor of 10 for a third world country would not do. So basically a Chinese Vietnam which would probably look like North Korea/khmer Rouge.

And in the impossible scenario where the South wins with No Chinese/Soviet intervention then Vietnam would be the same/worse. It was horribly corrupt under the South leadership(main reason so many southerners supported the North, mainly farmers but still). When the people are united and dont see ideologies as enemies but instead their fellow citizens that oppress them. Then there will be more war. This Vietnam would most likely follow the path of Iraq.

The last scenario is the US intervenes. I will not add nukes(also it's boring) because it is MAD in that scenario because both China and US had nukes. China stomps the US out of Southeast Asia easily. American public wouldnt have the stomach to lose 300k+ soldiers for an impossible war. If the US intervenes anyway then they lose hundreds of thousands of soldiers and experience an economic fall the likes of which it has never seen before. The Soviet Union has a field day and expands elsewhere like Philippines/Indonesia/Africa with almost 0 intervention. ","I have nothing but admiration for the Vietnamese people. Within a span of 30 years the French were expelled, the United States was stopped from partitioning or exerting control over the country, and shortly thereafter a Chinese invasion was repelled. The Vietnamese also deposed the Khmer Rogue in Cambodia, a regime responsible for massacring millions of people.

Understandably, you look to countries that have done well out of being within the US sphere of influence, like South Korea. Remember though that the Rhee regime, which was supported by the US during the Korean war, was also responsible for massacring 100's of thousands of civilians. At the time, alignment with the great power that would exert the least influence over Vietnam (the Soviet Union) was likely the best option.

Your people have a heroic history and you should be proud of it.

To work, censorship must be pretty broad.  Otherwise you see people making end-runs around that censorship and finding widespread agreement.

"The entire point of civil disobedience is to make uncomfortable or make inconvenient what is beloved by the mainstream. These things could be beloved things like first night in Boston for example, sit-ins, blocking off ramps. I can get behind shutting that down to raise awareness (I can't recall for certain if that was directly tied to #BlackLivesMatter, but it was certainly tied to the momentum begun under the Ferguson protests.) By interrupting the speech they were acting in that vein. By demanding four and a half minutes of silence they were acting in that vein. Even by making the statements about Seattle is a racist city they were acting in that vein (In response to the ""Let Bernie Speak"" chants). Where I think they made a miscalculation was in refusing to give back the mic. I suspect they refused to do that because people in the rally were no respecting the moment of silence (which was pretty tactless on the people crying ""Let Bernie Speak"").  

If the objective was about exposing the hypocrisy of white progressive liberals, how does forcing him to leave, then give a scripted response, and making Sanders out to be another unappreciated advocate accomplish that objective? Sanders respected their actions by standing to the side, letting them speak and not speaking during the moment of silence. I don't mention that to make Sanders out to be some saint, only to outline a rationale for what could have happened had they given back the mic. I don't think its unreasonable he would have told the crowd that they shouldn't have spoken during the moment of silence, then speak on the topics, if only briefly, that #BlackLivesMatter want to have, and then resumed to the itinerary of the rally. But even a brief detour like that would have been a massive statement: #BlackLivesMatter has a primacy in this political cycle over other political issues, they can dictate the conversation if they so choose, and force others to recognize the issues at hand, which *is the entire point of the hashtag*. Instead, they created another martyr of under-appreciated advocacy. It was a miscalculation. 

Moreover, the fallout is reminiscent of the fall of the Puerta del Sol and OWS protests. Both fizzled out because they became about purity, infighting and diversifying of objectives unrelated to the root cause of the protest. #BlackLivesMatter advocates are already concerned about other groups trying to hijack the hashtag for their subgoals. I was at the end of the Puerta del Sol protests, and believe me, it can get all over the place politically very quickly and that is a fast way for a movement to die out. I am not saying that there isn't a hypocrisy and blind spot in the mentality and thought of white progressive liberals, but not acknowledging how purity and infighting brought down other recent social media driven protests, advocates like these two are making a big mistake.

He had already hired Symone, she had already written her speech to introduce him Saturday night and speak out about how we need to end institutionalized racism in the country. The page on racial issues had already been written. 

Essentially, BLM asked Bernie to change in July, and by all appearances he has embraced the BLM message and changed in all the ways they asked of him. The ""protest"" yesterday did absolutely nothing to help their cause because they've already won Bernie over and he's already clearly the biggest supporter of the movement of all current candidates.

"I think that Weinberg's statement could be right with different definitions for both ""religion"" and ""evil things"". Firstly, ""religion"" would have to be expanded to mean any strongly held belief which forms a core of beliefs and is often immune to criticism from it's adherents. This interpretation could include things such as international communism or pan-nationalist racism, rather than simply organised religion which is a fairer comment.  
Secondly, ""evil things"" would have to be narrowed to mean things more specific than just what society considers to be extremely bad. For instance, killing another in self-defence would not be considered evil, and arguably neither is killing to resolve a situation. Arguably it would take the premeditated and dispassionate murder of an individual which can only come from blind devotion to a religion (in the expanded sense). In other words, it takes religion to push the aspects of human nature which are simply nasty into evil.","&gt;convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.

That depends. When do you define a person by their actions whether they're good and when do you define them by their ideology?

Indoctrination happens in mostly religious households and scenarios. Yes, political as well, but when it comes to beliefs and values I think religion does the indoctrination part a bit more. Especially with the whole ""hell if you don't believe"" idea.

I think that someone isn't a good person if they have an ideology I disagree with. I think nationalists are bad, fascists are bad and so on. So when it comes to ideology, they're not good people doing bad things, they're bad people doing bad things.

&gt;show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.

I mean it's all about interpretation.

""Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.""

He's certainly right when saying with or without religion, good people would do good things and bad people would do evil things.

Some actions aren't evil, yet aren't good either. So maybe good people could do bad things yet not evil.

Theft is an obvious example. It's not a good thing surely, and good people could do this whether or not they were religious, for different reasons. But it's hardly *evil*. Sometimes, theft is necessary or them to survive.

"I see a lot of people here falling for the false-dichotomy trap. I want to take a different approach.

While X may be better than Y, I want to change your view that this is irrelevant. M is superior to both, and that is more important in your life.

1. Pronunciation. M is easy to say, not too harsh, not too soft. Saying, ""Mmmmm"" describes deliciousness. It is so great that it is often the first sound a baby makes.

2. Restrained Popularity. M is a pretty popular letter, but not overused. It is right around the middle of the [letter frequency chart in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_the_English_language). M is a common but not overused first-letter as well, in part because it is such a pleasant sound to make. Mmmm. Furthermore, while neither X nor Y are present in all languages, M is universal on [this chart on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_other_languages), and it retains a solid medium frequency between 2% and 5%. Used, but not overused.

3. Consistency. M is also always a consonant. X cannot make up its mind regarding the sound it makes. Zuh? Chi? What is it, X?

4. Scrabble. M, with its restrained popularity, is a happy tile to come across. You get a middling number of points (3) but what you lack in points you more than make up for in usability. Sometimes you can even use more than one M in the same word! Can you say Double Letter Score? Thanks M!

5. Use in math. M is the first letter of the word math. You are welcome. End of discussion. 

6. Appearance. M is such a beautiful form that we have modelled other letters after it: W is an upside-down M with some sharpness and E is a sideways M with some flatness. We even find the influence of its beauty in numbers as 3 is a sideways M with more roundness. Marvellous.

7. Sex. Mmmm, sex is good. How do you get sex? Money. Boom.

8. History. Malcolm X, not Xalcolm X. History museums, not xuseuxs. The second millennium, not xillenniux. You practically cannot even say words with X properly.

9. Versatility in other areas. Without the M in medicine there would be no x-rays, and without a ""M""ap there would be no treasure.

"&gt; Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange.

The economy also includes the exchange goods *and services*, not goods alone. So lawyers, doctos, yoga instructors all exchange their services for goods and services from others.

What do you mean by this exactly? It may not require too much skill, but it's hard work and does require speed and attention to detail while picking the blueberries.

People choose to eat junk, and buy replaceable products. The money that people save by not spending on electronics goes to other goods and services.

"&gt; Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.

I don't see the inconsistency. Perhaps sex acts *simply do* require consent, whereas eating non-sapient animals *simply doesn't* require consent. Where is the contradiction?

But here are a few moral frameworks, and arguments from each. Note that it isn't so important whether these frameworks are *true*, only that they are consistent frameworks which justify both beliefs in question.

* Natural Law theories seek to ground norms in their natural *purpose*. The *purpose* for sex might be procreation. Therefore, sex with animals is wrong, since procreation is impossible. (An alternate purpose might be solidifying bonds with one's partner. But, while this purpose may exist between humans, it is dubious it could work between humans and non-human animals. Bestiality is plausibly psychologically harmful.) Carnivorism, on the other hand, doesn't seem impermissible on natural law theory.
* Consequentialism holds that consequences are the primary aspect of moral consideration. Perhaps eating animals leads to greater net happiness. (Maybe not the current methods of factory farming, but what about responsible free range farming, where animals have good lives before being taken for food?) Perhaps bestiality contributes net negative consequences. Under such conditions (which aren't necessarily that implausible), consequentialism would entail that bestiality is wrong, but eating meat is, in some cases, permissible.
* Virtue Ethics entails that a person's character attributes are the primary aspect of moral evaluation. Perhaps a virtuous character would eat meat in many circumstances (like if he knew it wasn't prepared irresponsibly with extravagant suffering, for example) but wouldn't have sex with animals. (Perhaps because they believed it destroyed the dignity of both the human and the non-human animal?)","The benefit gained by eating an animal is much greater than the benefit gained by having sex with one (I would even argue that there are zero benefits to having sex with an animal).  Therefore, eating animals has a higher threshold of harm caused before the net result is a harmful effect rather than a beneficial one.  With having sex with animals, the threshold is extremely low, perhaps even to the point that any harm caused causes the action to become a net harmful action.

&gt;Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.

&gt;Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam

&gt;How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?

In the case of semen collection, there is the benefit at the end of having the sperm needed to create a new generation of cattle (to which the bull is also a recipient of the benefit, even if they do not consciously relize it).  In the case of a zoophile inserting their  penis, there is no equivalent benefit gained by anyone.

You may not subscribe to my moral framework, but to me it is very consistent, logical, and easy to follow.  I make an estimate of the pro's and con's of every action and then come to an estimate of whether each action is a net positive or a net negative (when compared to other possible actions, impossible theoretical scenarios are not included into the calculation as they are not possible).  At the end, I describe whatever action has the most net benefit as the most moral, and whichever has the most net harm as the least moral.  This does mean that many actions that some people see as equivalent in their own moral system are seen as unrelated in mine, as in the case of carnivorism versus zoophilia.  The central tenant of consent in your own moral system does not factor very heavily in mine.",1,2,False,Response 2 provides a clear and logical argument based on the concept of net benefit gained from actions.

Literature has a wonderful way of imparting morals - those hours spent hallucinating the words on pages in our minds seems to have a positive effect on people's feelings. So many people *identified* with the troubles of Holden Caulfield when they were younger and his reconciliation helped them reconcile something inside themselves, it did for me. Besides, fiction is a great way of expanding our knowledge of history, language, art, and much more. Reading To Kill a Mockingbird is to be taken back to another time and *live* the experience through the characters in the book. And some books serve an important social function - 1984 is hailed as a visionary work.

I love reading fiction, and I know that I'm not alone. When I'm reading I'm even less alone.","To each their own, but the 'life' you propose doesn't seem worth living, and I'm an educated person who does spend a lot of time reading non-fiction and watching docos. Should people take an active interest in bettering themselves physically and mentally? Absolutely. But what's the point of being smart or strong if your miserable? I think you are too quick to dismiss the value and importance of entertainment.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of how fiction can improve individuals by imparting morals, expanding knowledge, and serving important social functions.

"You are saying:

1. We don't require an animal's consent for being kept as a pet, nor for eating it or consuming its milk, so consent is not relevant to human-animal interactions;
2. Sex is just another human-animal interaction;
3. Hence consent is also not relevant to humans having sex with animals, aka bestiality.

Clearly (1) is true, and (3) is a simple logical inference. But the weak point in your argument is (2), i.e., your assumption that there isn't anything special about sex.

In actuality, there are some things that are special about sex, in particular in regards to consent. We are ok with an adult playing basketball with a consenting minor, or forcing a minor to go to school even without consent, but we are not ok with an adult having sex with a minor in any situation. In other words, there are things adults can do with children that do not require their consent (forcing them to go to school) and there are things we do not consider children to be able to consent to in any situation (sex), even though the majority of adult-child interactions are guided by consent (playing basketball).

The argument could then be made, that animals are a parallel to children. Animals can be forced to do some things without their consent, like keeping them as pets or eating them for food, which would parallel adults forcing children to go to school. We don't require consent in those areas. And there are some things that we just do not consider animals to be able to consent to, and are therefore forbidden, namely sex, which would be a direct parallel to sex with children.

Now, you make a fair point that there might be a form of inconsistency here - why is it ok to ignore consent in some areas, and not in sex? However, the same potential inconsistency exists in society's treatment of children, and not just in society's treatment of animals, so if there is an inconsistency (debatable) it is at least one which society applies in a consistent way between animals and children.
","&gt;  I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.

You're taking a lot of liberties where society does not.  We do throw out the concept of consent for ownership, but not for *everything*.  In fact it's fairly common for one person to break into another person's car if a pet is locked in without ventilation.  People are willing to put their rights and safety at risk and to damage another person's property.  There are comparable with excessively disciplining animals.  Society at large doesn't just think that an owner can do as they please with their pets.

&gt;  The vast majority of human beings eat animals.

Here you are merging the concept of animals as pets and animals as food.  While in many cases the animal is the same, the relationship is starkly different.  It would be like saying that humans are ok with other humans being beaten nearly to death because we all know that it happens in torture scenarios.  There are corner case scenarios which allow for a set of behaviors but that does not mean that they can be extended to everything.  Humans make what we feel are necessary concessions in the treatment of animals because we ultimately need them to become our food.  This does not mean that we approve of everything that happens so much as we may not be able to stop it.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced argument that addresses the OP's points directly. It breaks down the issue of consent in human-animal interactions and draws parallels to the treatment of children, which helps to highlight the importance of consent in certain situations.

One of the things we have that your elected kings did not was term limits. Let's say Clinton or Bush wins the Presidency. Who runs against him in 2020? Who gets the Presidency in 2024? Neither family will have an especially qualified candidate then. ","Every President of the U.S. except for one has descended from John Lackland, a king of England.

"I can see 2 reasons:

*  **Free speech**

At least in the US, the government's power to ban people (yes, including corporations) from saying things is strictly limited.  They can regulate the speech to require that it be true, and that it give appropriate disclaimers.  But for fairly good reasons, we don't let the government ban people from saying true things.

Drug ads are commercial speech, and subject to a lot more restriction than something like political speech would be, but an outright ban would still be over the line.

* **The information can be helpful**

Many people have low level chronic conditions that can be treated by medication, but which don't prompt them to make a doctor's visit.  Seeing that their symptoms appear to match what's described, and that they can take a pill to help that, can materially improve their lives.","There are some cases where it makes a lot of sense.  Take Viagara for example.  Lots of people were suffering from ED which they either thought was normal (ie not a medical condition which could be treated with medicine), or were embarrassed about.

"The flaw in your thinking is that people don't change their beliefs over time.  You know all of those ""old Conservatives"" that are starting to die off?  They were bra-burning, free-loving, pot-smoking hippies in the 1960s.  They were ""young liberals.""  

It isn't that conservatism was popular in 50 years ago and now it's been replaced with liberalism.  It's that people tend to be liberal when they're young and *become* more conservative over time.

But Republicans *are* winning elections. Republicans hold the House (by a wide margin) and the Senate.  There are way more Republican governors than Democrats. 

Additionally, how people vote in election depends on a lot more than the views the candidates hold.  The overall assessment of how the country is doing, especially its economy, is a huge factor.  If everything is going well, incumbents (and the incumbent party) get a boost.  If not, incumbents (and the incumbent party) are hurt.  You can see this with the House and Senate.  During and shortly after the end of the unpopular Bush presidency, the House and Senate were solidly Democrat.  But as the economy continued to slump under Obama, they've both gone back to solidly Republican.  People's opinions didn't drastically change in that time.  It's more that the overall political climate shifted.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a strong argument by pointing out the natural progression of individuals becoming more conservative as they age. By highlighting this trend, it challenges the notion that public opinion and party platforms are static, ultimately showing that shifts in beliefs are common and expected.",0
"This is only partly true. People don't talk about how much they hate paedophilia because it rarely comes up in day-to-day life, and because pretty much everyone hates it. If someone asks you what the worst qualities in a potential date are, you're not gonna say ""paedophilia"" because that kind of goes without saying. There's no reason to mention it. When someone complains about that arsehole Mike scratching their car, it's because they work with Mike every day and he consistently annoys them, not because they are a secret car-scratcher. 

It's true for certain things like homosexuality. I'm not a psychologist, but at a guess I'd say that's because homosexuality doesn't really affect you unless you're gay or someone you know is, so there's little reason to get angry about it otherwise. Again, that's just a guess.

"&gt; Does it have something to do with getting the slightest advantage when playing other people? Do gamers with the highest refresh rates perform better? Does getting the most headshots mean more than enjoying an immersive experience?

Short answer: yes. Long answer: not every video game is story-driven. If you're playing multiplayer CoD, LoL, or WoW, you're going to want the high FPS in order to be able to react better. Not everybody wants to be told a story in games (especially not triple-A games - I haven't enjoyed a triple-A story since Portal, which was also only arguably triple-A), and for those people, anything much less than 60 FPS - especially something as low as 25-30 - is very, very bad.

&gt; I just wish there was a way to limit the frame rate to 24 or 30. It would look fantastic.

Many games nowadays (especially PC games) have FPS caps you can adjust. They usually slide all over, from very low to 120 and up. Look into GTA - it's possible there's a mod that would help install it. This is probably the best solution - lower FPS isn't for everyone, but some people - like you - enjoy it and would prefer an easy way to limit it.

&gt; I suppose that's the sticking point: immersion. A high frame rate does not immerse me in a video game. It does the opposite.

I guess this is the crux of the matter: not everyone feels this way. Personally, I see very little difference whether the game is 25 FPS or 60 - if the story is engaging, I'll like the game. Persona 4 Golden is one of my favorite games story-wise, and IIRC it's got an FPS of 60 - that doesn't affect the story IMO. I find it hard to really get immersed in a game unless the writing is good, regardless of graphics (although sometimes graphics will be a turn-off) - even though To The Moon isn't the prettiest pixel art I've seen, I got totally engrossed in it and played it through in one sitting. To me, high frame rate isn't a bad thing - bad storytelling, grammatical errors, and graphical glitches are what will turn me off in terms of immersion.

For you, is 60FPS bad for games' storytelling? Sure, why not. For absolutely everyone else, is this also true? Not in the slightest.","Part of the issues depend on what game you're playing, as well as what you're used to.

For the first: a really twitch-based shooter like Counter-Strike is going to be more dependent on a high frame rate than a turn-based strategy game like Civilization. Generally, the faster paced the game is the more dependent on framerate your experience.

Secondly: I play on PC. I've only ever played on PC. I started looking at games at 60FPS, so that's what I'm used to as a *bare minimum*. I'll turn down settings to keep that frame rate. 30 just looks jerky and bad to me. In much the same way, since it appears that 30 is what you're used to, 60 seems ""off"" or ""wrong""

Yes, it generally is a PC thing but that's because PC is more able to push 60FPS on more games, since usually having things like tesselation and high quality textures at high resolution is a trade-off with frame rate, most consoles elect to go with 30FPS and turn their graphics settings up, rather than turn their graphics settings down and hit 60FPS",1,1,True,"Response 1 is more persuasive because it directly addresses the OP's concerns about frame rate limiting immersion in video games.

"It's not a matter of justice or what's right. The fact is that we value the life of a human over the life of an animal.

"Let's go by your points one by one:

1. It's easy to say this so casually when your entire way of life and your actual life itself is not what's at risk. A war with North Korea could trigger some very hard times for both North and South. Any economic benefits to be reaped would likely be in the long term. It's easy to call for sacrifice when you are not the one sacrificing. Who is to say unification will save lives? Violent, forced unification might cause extreme civil unrest, decades of terrorism, and continued or even accelerated loss of life on both sides. Unifying through full on war and unifying post-North Korean collapse are very different prospects that entail different likelihoods of success.

2. That is true. Many experts predict that unification could be an economic boon. The same Goldman Sachs report that you are unknowingly referencing also states that this is under the assumption of most optimal circumstances (i.e. gradual and peaceful reunification). That circumstance is only most likely post natural internal North Korean collapse and not through violent takeover. North Korea is not ready to be a stable state if taken over.

3. 60 years of consisted foreign policy doesn't change overnight. Their greatest concerns aren't cultural ones and more military. China, despite being a large coastal country, is landlocked militarily speaking by two great island chains - both of which are, in one way or another, under US control. The Korean peninsula is part of these chains (they form the mainland connection to the islands). North Korea falling further exacerbates America's cornering of China. It's a militarily strategic concern more than anything.

Again, I think it's important to emphasize this. It's easy to be hawkish when it's not your life that's being thrown away. Some things to keep in mind.","The government of South Korea represents the people of South Korea, not the entire Korean peninsula.  War and re-unification would be terrible for South Koreans, even if it would probably help North Koreans in the long run.

South Korea is already an economic powerhouse, they don't need the north for that. Taking on the cost of modernizing North Korea would put an incredible strain on the government and the nation as a whole.  It would hurt their economy for decades, not help it.

So war would cost many South Korean lives and significant destruction in South Korea, and it wouldn't gain them anything other than tremendous debt.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed breakdown of the potential consequences of war and unification, highlighting the risks and complexities involved. It also addresses the economic benefits in a nuanced way, pointing out the challenges and uncertainties.

"Police often go after out of town drivers because they can make more money off of them (for various reasons). If a cop is ordered to bust out of town plates before in-town plates, it is reasonable to assume that he will pull over a foreigner going 67 before a resident going 70 (in a 60 speed limit) right next to each other. What if the driver going 70 kills someone right after? Would you hold the police force responsible for this? Technically they pulled over a safer driver for an opportunity to make more money. 

Think about how much this kind of behavior could hurt society: In business we call optimizing our resources to make the most money in certain areas *targeting*. This is a kind of discrimination, but because businesses do not have a moral or legal obligation to market their services to the whole population, there is nothing wrong with it. However, police forces are expected to offer their services to the whole population without discrimination, economic included. Bottom line: The two target areas of enforcement ""make society safest"" and ""make the most money for police force"" are not identical. So which area would you rather be enforced by your police?","Conflict of interest. The purpose of the police, in almost every area, is to protect and serve, not to protect, serve, and raise money. If police are getting more money from giving tickets to speeders than doing other duties, such as monitoring for phone usage in school zones or providing a presence in a neighborhood as a deterrent or pursuing other, more dangerous offenders, that's a problem.

I, personally, would much prefer my local police force to prioritize danger, and not have to worry that they'll be busy doing the easy jobs or the cash-grabbing jobs when they should be protecting and serving. I don't want my local police worrying about anything that isn't keeping the public safe and being fair in that enforcement.

And then there's the issue of discrimination. Will cops see a shitty, cheap car speeding and ignore it because they think the driver can't pay up, but pursue all the luxury cars and give them every conceivable charge in the interest of milking them?

"As to why it's OK to mock some religions but not others in American culture, look up the meaning of [punching up vs. punching down](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2014/07/21/never-punch-down/). 

Mocking a majority religion like Christianity is degrees edgier than mocking a minority religion like Islam. Yes, I know a minority of Christians are LDS, but Mormons have become a cultural force in America whether: a major university with a powerhouse football program (BYU), the last Republican presidential candidate (Mitt Romney), and the numerous Mormons in business executive positions (Marriott for instance, from what I recall). 

Muslims, on the other hand, get lots of shit for choosing their faith, with the stereotype of being terrorists/terrorist apologists/anti-American rising post 9/11. look at how many ""Obama is a covert Muslim"" remarks have been spread around AM radio, blogs, Free Republic, etc. since Obama entered the national political scene. The ""All-American Muslim"" reality show, an attempt to show how Muslims are ""just as American"" as WASPs, backfired big time, while the same audiences offended by such a show embrace reality TV about fundamentalist Christianity like ""19 Kids and Counting"".

TL;DR: Mocking a majority religion = standing up to a bully, mocking a minority religion = kicking a dead man.","I'm going to take a guess here and say it has something to do with how mature the culture is that follows the religion.

Mormons, from what I've seen, are mature people who, if you say something dumb about their religion to them, will rather ignore you for being dumb then take actual offence by it. One can talk and discuss religion in general with them without the feeling they are talking to either a wall or a broken record.

A lot of Christians I know are similar, you can mock their faith all you want, they understand that different people hold different views and not everybody believes as they do and it's fine. Joke about the religion and they laugh, say something dumb about it and they ignore you.

Yet other Christians I've met or heard about seem to want to grab arms as soon as a non-believer even mentions god. Or treat you as if you're denying the day and night cycle.

Most people I know that follow the Islam are different than that, the ""mature"" people will simply not like it when you joke about the religion and give you very foul looks if you say something dumb about it. The not-so-mature folks will take greater offence.

In the end, the reason why I think it's okay to joke about some religions and not others is because some religions have a lot of supporters that get really pissed if you joke about their religion.

As for how it should be, or rather, how I think it should be, acceptance for people saying dumb shit should be lower. I'm all for freedom of speech, it's important and should be an universal basic right. It should NOT be about how dumb religious people are and it should not be about how all non-believers should go to hell. It's not helping anybody, doesn't change opinions and only stirs up trouble for no good reason. Somebody yelling something thats obviously wrong should be slapped (probably figuratively, *maybe* literally) and educated. You are free to believe what you want but your not free to sprout bullshit.

By discussing the concept of ""punching up vs. punching down"" and highlighting the power dynamics at play between majority and minority religions, Response 2 offers a more insightful perspective on the issue. This analysis takes into account societal attitudes, stereotypes, and power structures that influence how different religions are perceived and treated in American culture.",0
"One thing I haven't seen mentioned here is that skills tend to be less transferable then we assume.  A person who spends thousands of hours practicing and improving their ability to play chess doesn't actually improve their ability to remember strings of numbers.

They might be able to recite back the last 15 moves of the game they're playing, or have the entire board pictured in their head as they play blind folded, yet give them non-related memory tasks and they are no better then average.

Another thing that hasn't been mentioned is that when it comes to many skills, people tend to just stop improving after a while unless they put in deliberate effort.  The easiest example of this is typing speed.  People get better as they type more for a while, and then tend to stall at a relatively low speed unless they deliberately pursue something like typing lessons.

When you say that age should automatically equal respect, you bake in the assumption that the older you are, the more experienced you are.  What you neglect to account for though is that experience may only matter in a relatively narrow set of situations.

Let's say I own a bar.  If I ask my grandparents how I should market that bar, I'm sure they'll have opinions to give me.  If I ask a guy who has spent the last 2 years studying bar-marketing, he'll also have opinions to give me.  My grandparents have a lot more general life experience, but the marketer specializing in this field is clearly the better person to defer to.

Let's say instead of a bar, I have a tech company.  We're a software-as-a-service outfit specializing in text-message based marketing.  If I ask a group of 60 year old advertising agency executives how to market this, and then I ask a group of 20-somethings who've been doing online marketing for 3 years how to market this, I'm likely to get very different answers.

The older advertising agency executives might have 30 years each in advertising behind them.  They've done radio, TV, direct mail, etc.  The younger web solutions group may only have 3 years each, specializing in cost-per-click, web copywriting, web design and usability.

I think both groups would have important insights, but I would never ignore the younger web-focused group just because the ad agency has been around 10 times longer.  The younger group has more experience with situations very close to my problem, whereas the older group has general, broad-based experience but may or may not understand the nuances of this specific medium.

So how does this tie back into what your saying?  When it comes to ethical and personal choices, very few people deliberately practice to improve, and so I would expect people's talent there to peak at a relatively young age.  I wouldn't expect a 50 year old to automatically be a better authority on moral issues then a 25 year old.

When it comes to business or work decisions, although people gain a lot of experience in a certain set of situations, I'm not convinced the skills gained 'transfer' as much as we intuitively believe.

Given all that, there is some merit to the idea that you should only automatically defer to older people in some area if they have a legitiment claim to closely-related expertise.

Now young people who have no closely-related expertise are in a similar no-automatic respect situation, and if your going to be working together, there is a strong argument to be made that if they don't know very much, they should defer up the hierarchy.  But that's not an age based deference, that's a position based deference.  That's not so much due to some owed respect, rather that is the case for efficiency reasons.  If everyone argues with their supervisors whenever they kind of vaguely suspect they know better, then they will waste a lot of time and energy doing non-productive things.  Even if the more junior person is right, if the issue is such a marginal one as to make no real difference, then it's not an issue worth bringing up.

edit: To quickly add to this, the times I've most often witnessed blatant disregard for the respect deserved to a position was in university classes when mature students were present and monopolizing a professors time during class, and work situations where a younger person is supervising an older person.","&gt;Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers.

Yes, that is what young people are objecting to: the idea that simple time on the planet demands deference (by which I assume you mean that the older person's view is considered valid and reasonable unless proved false).

&gt;to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason

Well, let's distinguish groups for a moment.  Because as I see it, you're treating three groups as being the same thing.

(1).  People who have established themselves in the area they're discussing (so a professor of public health talking about Obamacare)

(2).  People who have established themselves in an unrelated area (a professor of physics talking about Obamacare)

(3).  People who are older but do not otherwise have establishing credentials.

Your argument seems to be that group (3) deserves deference because groups (1) and probably (2) deserve it.

&gt;Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.

But that experience would need to be relevant and established.  Otherwise your argument is that simply being alive is experience, and thus that age by itself is worthy of respect.

To wit, a 23-year-old law school student knows more about the dormant commerce clause than a sixty-year-old steel mill foreman.  The latter's life experience is irrelevant to that discussion.

&gt;2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.

Except your argument isn't a neutral version of respect where we accept that everyone can have a different opinion and there's really nothing age has to do with that.  Your argument is for *deference*, which would mean the younger person submits on the issue to the older person.  That *does* cost something if the issue is either (a) the younger person believes he has a better way to do things, or (b) the younger person believes he is right and the older person is wrong.

If that weren't true, you wouldn't be posting a CMV, since your logic says that you ""deferring"" to me costs you nothing.

&gt;Plenty of people ""proved themselves"" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to ""earn respect"".

And in cases where that's true, the person can say ""oh, and I also have my Ph.D in the subject we're discussing.""  Again, you're treating people with credentials and people without credentials like they're the same group.

&gt;Except the argument's merit can very be based on passed experience. Something older people generally have more of.

1.  Past experience, not passed.

OP: in your view, would you say that a response to this would be to stop being proud citizens of X or Y country and instead became proud citizens of the planet instead? I think it's the next logical step considering human evolution. We gathered into families to keep eachother safe/overcome shared problems. Then families grouped to form villages, then tribes, then city-states etc. Although I don't feel we as a species are quite ready for it yet (but that's a discussion for another time and place. Preferably a pub with a beer in my hand) the world is such a connected place now and we know so much about it (eg polluting the atmosphere in New Zealand will affect the climate in Switzerland) that it may be approaching the time when we have to form a larger group to face larger shared problems and insane levels of nationalism are holding this back

"Warning, anecdotal story ahead:

While it's easy to assume that violence is the easiest answer to a conflict like this, I have a recent personal example (where violence was encouraged) that worked out better bonviolently. 

A fried I'd made at school thought I stole weed from his house. He'd recently discovered the online drug market and was experimenting with all kinds of drugs. He was doing everything from ketamine, to LSD, to opiates. You get the idea. 

So what'd happened was that he couldn't find his stuff as soon as I'd left. The next time I went over, they were having a party. As soon as I'd walked in, this guy (high on percs) starts yelling ""that's the fucker who stole my dabs"" 

I'd heard that he thought that from someone, but I thought it'd be ridiculous for him to accuse me because he should know I'd never do something like that. I found out at that moment that he really thought I'd steal from him. He got up, got in my face, and started screaming at me calling me a theif, a liar, all while there's a good 20 people around staring. 

I stayed calm the entire time. I knew I could resort to violence, but I'd always been taught nonviolence will get you farther. 

I removed myself from the situation, calmly told him I'm sorry that he thinks I'd do something like that, but that I'd leave. 

Banned from the house, I found out later that he'd found what he thought I stole waaay under a couch. When we head back to school in August he wants to talk and apologize to me for everything and clear the air. 

Now I could've punched him in the face one of the multiple times he tried to get physical. I could've screamed back. I could've called him a drug addicted fuck, beat the shit out of him, and still be seen in the right. 

Because I resorted to not using violence, and gave it time rather than resorting to getting physical, I may have one less burnt bridge. 

Whether or not he's a friend worth aging is another topic, but I feel this story sets up a good example for why nonviolence is a more desirable route. 


","But what happens when you lose your majority?  When people teach others via violence, the people they teach sometimes learn the intended message and other times learn that you are an oppressor who needs to be punished.  This is what happened to you, and you'd like to impose that violence on the people who hurt you.  All well and good, until the wheel turns (as it always does) and you find yourself in the minority again.  At that point, they'll be punishing you for your oppression.

Far better to teach the ignorant but allow them to persist in their ignorance if they wish.  They then learn *that* lesson if they won't learn the intended one.  When the wheel turns, they will therefore be less likely to act violently towards you.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a personal anecdote that directly relates to the situation at hand.

"&gt; If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs, how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other, less harmful drugs?

Maybe your premise is wrong about the objective of the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs came from the Nixon administration, with the *advertised* purpose ostensibly being to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs. But according to John Ehrlichman, who was counsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under Richard Nixon, the real purpose was different. Here is an excerpt from an interview with Dan Baum for the book ""Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure"":

&gt;The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar Left, and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black. But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

According to the book, the rationale for the war on drugs was to target people who were not likely to vote for Nixon: 

&gt;The young, the poor, and the black. Nixon couldn't make it illegal to be young, poor, or black, but he could crack down hard on the illegal drug identified with the counterculture.

If the book is right, acceptance of cigarettes falls in line exactly with the War on Drugs.","I don't disagree with your claim that the war on drugs is stupid (I choose to believe that's your claim, and I agree).  

But to answer your hypothesis about why we're mysteriously okay with cigarettes, it's because it's a lot easier to keep something away from people than it is to TAKE something away from people.  If the default stance on marijuana was already that it was legal, it'd still be legal everywhere and you wouldn't be seeing many people trying to get it banned.  Same as alcohol.  

But when something is *already* illegal, it's a lot easier to keep it that way.  If cigarettes were illegal already, they'd likely be staying that way, for exactly the reasons you mentioned.  People would be saying ""Why on earth should we legalize these things?  We haven't even legalized stuff that's far less dangerous!""",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides historical context and evidence that the War on Drugs was not actually about keeping people safe and not addicted to drugs, but rather about targeting specific groups of people. This challenges the premise of the original argument and provides a different perspective on why cigarettes are accepted despite being harmful.",0
"A better explanation is that asians do better because they have higher IQ.

this is also consistent with findings that jews have higher iq, and that jews do well in the US.

It is consistent with findings that blacks and hispanics have low iq, and that they perform worse in the US.

This is also consistent if you compare majority black countries, which are always underdeveloped, to white and or asian countries, which have a mix of level of development. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singpore and Japan are prosperous nations inhabited by majority asians, who have high iq.

"&gt; I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.

They're not lying to anyone when they throw the ""based on"" in front of the ""true story"".  So since it's a movie and they're telling you outright it's a dramatization then there's no reason to go through the song and dance of verifying it as 100% factual.  Things that are 100% factual would be a documentary, which these movies are not advertised as.

&gt; Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth'

But the tagline isn't ""based on truth"", the tagline is ""based on a true *story*"".  Of which, the original story may or may not even be 100% factual on what actually happened.  People exaggerate and mislead in their recounting of events all the time.  So I would have to say that calling something ""based on a true story"" is a level removed in facts than saying ""based on truth"".  The story is just a sequence of events that happened at some point in time, not down to the detail what actually happened.

&gt; And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.

Is there an inherent problem with getting some facts wrong or leaving them out?  Since it's a movie do you expect people going to see these films are going there to be educated or are going to just be entertained?  If they're going to be entertained then why are you worried about the factualness of the story?

&gt; Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch Pearl Harbour (2001).

What if I don't want to watch a Sci-Fi action film?  What if I want to watch Saving Private Ryan -esque movies that aren't documentaries?  Things like Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and other war movies/shows tend to be based on something so why do I only have the choice between a History Channel special on WWII or nothing at all?  Because to be completely honest, I would imagine a 100% factual movie about WWII would have either a *lot* of people just sitting around waiting for stuff to happen or would just be a hogepodge of battle scenes that don't really make a story.

I'm curious if you also hold the same standards for science.  Do you get really angry at space movies that fly things like planes and have fire or sound while people are floating around in the void?  I could go on about all the things those movies get wrong.  And I think that's a bit more grievous considering they actually *break physics*.  But in the end, it's entertainment.  If I wanted facts I'll go watch a documentary.","I sympathize with your frustrations, but I'm not sure I agree we need to start banning movies. A few points:



&gt; It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.

Actually, it really should. In any capacity. We should not be in the business of encouraging people to swallow stories wholesale, whether they find them in the theater, on the internet, in a book, or in the paper. If you are endeavouring to discover the ""true story"", you should already be looking at multiple sources. This isn't even a difficult thing to do - you managed to do it with a quick wikipedia search.



&gt;People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can).

How someone interprets the word ""based"" is not the responsibility of the filmmaker. All the simulacrum in the world does not change basic definitions.



&gt; If you want to learn history, want a documentary.

While it's true that documentaries are often held to a higher standard than historical films, this does not make them infallible. A lot of what passes under the genre of ""documentary"" is heavily biased, or even outright doctored. Films do you the courtesy of letting you know they are fabricated, whereas any fabrication in documentaries is presented as unvarnished truth. Should we ban documentaries too?  



&gt;""We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson"".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?

Because people are interested in history, but they are also interested in the human condition, and how people relate to one another. Sometimes, they would prefer this to historical accuracy. Pearl Harbour's main purpose was to tell a story of love in a time of war - the focus was on human drama, and not historical accuracy. It's perfectly fine to criticize them about this, but why would you get outraged over Bruckheimer being honest about his intentions? He *should* be coming forward to clarify that history is his backdrop and not his subject. I'd be more infuriated if he was *not* up front about this. 




I'm not going to say that people can't be easily misled, because they certainly can. But what is the alternative? 100% accuracy in all things? In many historical cases we can't even form a working consensus on what happened, or for what reason - that doesn't eliminate the ancient drive to tell stories about our history. If filmmakers want to be as accurate as possible they can - the Band of Brothers series comes to mind. But if they would prefer not to, and are happy to tell us that they are not even trying, what's the problem?",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a more nuanced perspective on the issue, acknowledging the importance of historical accuracy while also recognizing the value of storytelling and human drama in films.

"The problem with sex as an obligation is that it equates to a sort of penance.  No one wants to live their life in perpetual punishment for the disinterest in sex.  

Also, even if they were to agree *most people* are somewhat aware of their partner's feelings.  Having sex with a partner who performs the act with the same interest as most of us have while cleaning our bathroom is a losing proposition.  Louis CK has a great skit on [The saddest Hand job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=betkymYDzfg).  The short of it is that his wife agrees to giving him a hand job after a long time of not being sexual with him in any way.  He should feel excited, but instead he feels pathetic, rejected and resentful of her.  ","Sex is *not* a physiological necessity. Simple as that. It has physiological benefits, but you don't need it to survive.

Sex is, for all intents and purposes, a hobby that you share with your partner, and yes, it is fulfilling in a way that many other activities aren't, but you won't die without it. You won't get sick without it. It won't take years off your life, or even impair your psychological performance, if you aren't getting laid.

Having that fulfillment is great, but it's not a necessity in your life, and moreover it is selfish to assume that just because your partner is disinterested in sex they are also no longer in need of that fulfillment and you are somehow more entitled to it than they are.

When your partner loses interest in sex, something is probably happening with their body or their mind that should be addressed by *both* parties. If otherwise healthy, sexual people are having problems with sexual interest, the first step is not obligation-sex. It's doctors visits. Depression, high estrogen/low testosterone, reproductive disorders, malnutrition, anxiety, vaginismus, and bacterial infections are just a FEW of the physical and psychological reasons why sustained disinterest in sex might be a problem. It's rarely ""I'm just not attracted to you anymore"" (and when that's the case, if sex is a requirement in your relationship, it's time to terminate that relationship).

And for people with libido high enough to cause them physical discomfort or adverse effects when their sexual desires aren't being met, I'd actually argue that a more equitable solution would be to speak to a doctor about that, too. A high enough sex drive that you NEED to have sex regularly on a physical level should be addressed medically, not by contractually violating another person's right to choose whether or not they have sex.

"You've asked this a few times: ""would you agree that ""forcing your ideas on others"" is not a fair attack on pro-life legislation?""

No, I don't agree. It's absolutely a fair attack, because of the word ""ideas"" (or alternatively, ""beliefs"").

In our society and in common language, the word ""idea"" or ""belief"" is not applied to a concept that is - for all intents and purposes - universally agreed upon. Most people would not say the phrase ""murder is wrong"" is an ""idea"" or a ""belief"". Because basically everyone (except murderers) agrees on that, we talk about it as more of an objective **fact**. An underlying assumption we all have, that we then use for further discussion.

Please note that this doesn't mean something IS objective fact simply because everyone, or almost everyone, agrees. I'm just saying that's how we as a society tend to treat these topics.

On the other hand, when there is significant disagreement on a subject, the viewpoints of one side (or one person) IS generally referred to as an ""idea"" or ""belief"". So when people say pro-lifers are trying to force their ideas on everyone else, that's a fair statement. 

The converse isn't really true, either. You couldn't say that pro-choice people are ""forcing their beliefs"" because by definition, that side is advocating for choice. They are not saying you CAN'T do something, or saying you MUST do something. They are simply saying that the choice should exist. Offering someone that choice might offend you, but you are nonetheless not being forced to do anything.

"I'm only going to challenge this for the part where:

&gt;I believe the only difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship/platonic relationship is physical attraction.

And it's not going to be about mystical forces or destiny or any such nonsense. It's going to be about my own crude understanding of modern neuroscience. 

The part you're missing in the above description is that romantic love also has two other key components in most tests, which I'll call **prioritization** and **interconnection**.

I'll start with the latter because it's harder to catch, but easier to visualize: **Interconnection** is how much your thoughts about X are connected to other thoughts. In simplified terms, whenever you think of ""Ice Cream"", your neurons will also send signals to other nearby concepts, such as the taste associated with ice cream, memories related to ice cream, images, coldness, and so on, and this propagates through a network of concepts and memories in your brain. 

With a normal person that you spend a lot of time with, that ""person"" in your mind is actually a lot of different concepts and nodes that connect to a lot of other things, and their name and face are only small parts of that. When you think about that girl Lorraine the Model, you're more likely to trigger the neurons in your brain related to the color pink because you know she likes pink, and she often wears it, so the connections between the nodes that contain your mental model of Lorraine are more closely connected with the nodes that fire off when you think of the color pink, than if you were to think about George the Office Guy. 

With someone that you're starting to get romantically attracted to, beyond the simple physical lust/attraction, it's frequently observed that you'll also start... ""enlarging"" the network of connections from that person-concept to other concepts and memories in your brain, so that ""they"" connect to more things in your mind... and more other things in your mind connect to ""them"". 

To visualize this, look at [this graph here](http://nickpegg.com/media/img/more_fun_with_graphs/nys-super-sanitized.png) and imagine this graph represents concepts in your mind. Green are clear concepts (""walking"", ""ice cream"", etc.), beige are specific memory data, and yellow are persons. Naturally this image isn't actually about neurons in brains, but it serves for this illustration. Notice the one yellow node that is so much more connected than the other yellow nodes? How it has many more memory/experience connections, but also due to its larger share of space is connected to more green concepts as well? 

That's the person you're getting romantically attracted to. 

**Prioritization** is simpler. It's when some concept in your mind has more affect associated with it, and thus holds higher *value*. It's frequently observed in tests that subjects will pay a higher cost to protect their SO / subject of romantic love than would be explained by the simple combination of platonic relationship and physical attraction. It's also harder to visualize, because it's not a linear number that you can just add up... letting that person cry for a few hours alone is still less negatively valued than letting your brother die, for instance. However, to take the graph analogy above, when a moral or hedonistic calculation goes through the nodes for this person, the resulting choice will weigh more heavily in that direction if the subject was one you were romantically attracted to than if the subject were only someone you were lusting for and had a platonic relationship with. 

In other words, it also depends on how much space they occupy in your mental map (measured by how often thinking about something else makes you also think about them) and how much emotion is generated when they are involved (measured by how long you spend crying if they tell you you're stupid vs someone else tells you you're stupid... or preferably some other, less painful method). Not just how much you interact with them, how much you trust them or how much you want to fuck them. ","There's a lot we don't understand about love, so I'm only speaking from personal experience when I say that I feel romantic attraction is different from platonic/sexual attraction. I have very good female friends with whom I love spending time and whom I find very attractive, but I'm for some reason not romantically attracted to them. It's a weird gut feeling when I am eventually romantically attracted to someone that's not really describable but goes beyond standard platonic and sexual desires. I'd describe romantic attraction as different from sexual attraction, even - my last crush was someone with whom I guess I would have slept had the opportunity arisen but for whom I fell because of non-sexual things (mostly because I felt really, really comfortable with her). I would describe my attraction to her less as ""I wanted to sleep with her"" and more ""I wanted to cuddle with her and talk.""

"THIS COMMENT

isn't like the rest of this thread. Most of these can be summed up as ""Eugenics are wrong Hitler are wrong you are Hitler DIEEEEE"". This is not that kind of comment, knowing that please read further.

Eugenics are wrong? Whoever thinks that is extremely close-minded, the only valid argument against eugenics is the risk that it would pose for a group to decide the future of all humans, everything is else is just religious crap or Godwin's law. Eugenics is great, our genes worked great once but now they're incredibly outdated, it's like trying to run Skyrim on windows 95, it's not gonna work well. Eugenics could eliminate anything from genetical diseases and push our lifespan beyond the 120 telomere barrier to eliminating pointless hormonally-triggered violence and improving the intelligence of the population.

Now your problem is the following (other than most likely there isn't a ""gay gene"" but rather some weird interaction of genes that have that effect), homosexuality is inferior to heterosexuality because it limits which people you find attractive to from 45% of the population (ie the 90% of the opposite gender that is straight/bi) to just 5% (ie the 10% of the same gender that is homosexual/bi). Everything else such as weird anatomical stuff and not being able to have children in a conventional way isn't that bad as homosexual sex is about as pleasurable as heterosexual one and artificial insemination and surrogate mothers can solve the problem of having children almost entirely.

Consequently, homosexuality is bad because it limits the number of available partners, but do you know what is almost as bad? *Heterosexuality*. Fuck that crap, bisexuals have it all, they can sleep with men and women alike, they can both enjoy the 90% from the opposite sex and then 10% from their same gender, they can enjoy both genders and experience the sensations that both genders experience, they're just *objectively* superior.

It doesn't matter how much hentai you watch or how many people of the same sex you try to sleep with, the fact is that to some extent sexual orientation is genetical and you can't change it. Having a bisexual genetical profile is a genetical advantage (not necessarily an evolutive one that's why it isn't more common) as it allows people to feel attracted to more people without any downside.

And thus, if we find a gay gene we should eliminate it, and if we find a straight gene we should obliterate it too, and instead put a bisexual gene in its place.

GOD I WISH BEING BISEXUAL WAS A CHOICE BUT I CAN'T, so I'll have to stick with the opposite sex I suppose, darn my luck, but it could be worse.","Logically speaking, if a ""gay gene"" exists, it would eliminate itself from the gene pool... eventually (naturally).

Gays don't reproduce naturally. Now if you are suggesting that gays shouldn't have the option to donate eggs/sperm in order to reproduce then you are perpetuating the culture you yourself are being demeaning off. 

Now let's just say you managed to change the culture associated with the hatred of the lgbt community entirely, and people really couldn't give a rats ass about who you love. In that case socio economics still limits the amount of gays that can afford to reproduce through the artificial insemination procedure. Eventually numbers would lower so much extinction would occur. 

All in all, I don't believe there is a view to change here other than your approach. Since what your asking is taking place by natural selection, all I can say is your reasoning for wanting this to happen is encouraging of the existing culture to dislike the community. Your reasoning seems to accept the bad values that people hold and proposes a solution to live with those bad values. By that reasoning, if we can locate a gene that produces bigots and eliminate that, we could solve all race and discriminatory issues! Unfortunately that would leave us with hardly any humans left.  

My conclusion is that nature in this sense shouldn't be messed with. If it needs taking care of, it will take care of itself. Even cultural systems that perpetuate a bad practice for no apparent value eventually come to an end when they come face to face with a larger opposing view (I.e. Cortes and the Aztecs, or Chritians and the Moors (aka Islamics)). 

Whether you believe in eugenics or not, your reason advocates for it, and if you truly are sincere in not advocating it but still believe in eliminating a certain community, then at that point you really are just discriminatory towards that group and therefore not an ally as you so claim.

"I think this is one of many examples of how much we haven't got our shit figured out when it comes to the internet yet.

Experiences in life are transitory. Memories fade, arguments and discussions forgotten, photos lost, and so on. When it comes to the internet we're stuck somewhere between expecting this experience to hold true online, and enjoying the fact that our lives are archived for our own nostalgic browsing and selective re-sharing (ie. TimeHop).

I think for many people see profile browsing as ""creeping"" because although they put the content there, the *intention* wasn't to share it with the world forever; it was to share it in that moment. The instinct is that it has an expiration date, but the technology doesn't facilitate it.

I figure sooner or later Facebook or whatever supplants it will figure this out and provide tools to auto-privatise content to their respective owners after a certain time period has elapsed, or some other mechanism I can't think of.  Alternatively we'll all just get used to the idea that our entire lives are archived online, and drop the idea that it should be ""creepy"" for someone to have enough curiosity/boredom to browse back through your life.

Personally, I'm a total creeper. The first thing I do on a new friend's Facebook is hit left to their first profile photo. Funtimes.","You're not really focusing on the ""creepy"" part of ""creeping.""

Simply because something exists and can be viewed, doesn't imply that viewing it is not creepy. Going through the half-decade or more of someone's internet history, just for kicks, is eerily voyeuristic, and frankly, makes someone genuinely ask: ""Why the hell would you do that?""

After dating someone for a year, I decided to go to facebook (I'd not been on in years at that point) and I looked my S/O up. I started looking at her photos, and felt weird. Why? Because I had unadulterated access to memories that weren't mine, experiences that I hadn't had, and it created a narrative of someone that they'd not taken the time to share with me. 

So I stopped. 

People put together online reserves of their memories, and *their memories* are things they want to briefly show off not be scoured later on by someone with nothing better to do. 

It's just creepy to ""creep.""",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more personal and relatable example of why ""creeping"" can be considered creepy.

"&gt;I understand that many would argue that the dogs are victims (as are drug addicts and prostitutes for that matter), but only in the sense that eating horse meat (which is illegal in many places) victimizes horses, or even horse racing, which is already legalized, taxed, and regulated in controlled environments.

None of those are comparable to dog fighting.

 - Prostitutes choose to be prostitutes, if not it is called slavery and is not necessary for prostitution.

 - Drug addicts are victims of their addiction, which they initially caused through their choices, and people would end addiction if it were easily done.

 - Horses are not fought to the death, they run, it's not a bad life for an animal, plenty of animals pull plows and shit.

 - Animals we eat are legally required to be treated humanely, because some people break these laws should now allow for legalizing further cruelty.

 - The real reason dog fighting is illegal (along with cock fighting, and human death matches) is that as western society we have drawn a line in the sand that is unacceptable to be entertained by death despite our instincts that seek it out.","&gt; I understand that many would argue that the dogs are victims (as are drug addicts and prostitutes for that matter)

These are not the same at all. Drug addicts and prostitutes may have been strongly pressured into their situation but on some level they have made the choice to behave that way (unless they are forced then it is human trafficking and not prostitution). Dogs do not choose to be in these dogfights. 

Dog fighting is different from eating an animal for meat because theoretically the animal isn't supposed to be hurt. Dog fighting hurts the animal inevitably. You could argue that you don't care but you can't say these things are the same.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced argument by comparing dog fighting to other activities involving animals and explaining why they are not comparable. The response also addresses the legality and regulation of horse racing and the treatment of animals we eat, providing a more well-rounded argument against dog fighting.",0
"This is a bit of a weird example, but Naughty Dog and Insomniac Games used to work in the same Universal Studios backlot. They pretty much worked in the same cubicles. The games they created, like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, were better games because of the constant chatting between members of the two companies. Each of the two examined the other company's software and saw amazing new features they could add to themselves. It was a source of friendly competition, and everyone was involved. The softwares the two companies created proved to be some of the most top-selling and highly regarded Playstation titles at the time. None of this innovation would have happened if the employees of both worked online without physical contact with each other. Doesn't this show that sometimes, physical environments do help to make a better software in the first place?","Yes, the coding part of software development requires focus.  Sure.

But good engineers care deeply about the product - they fight for things they care about, they tend to help define and drive features.

Tell me then, how do you come to consensus &amp; divide work with purely asymmetrical communication? How do you motivate remote employees?  

More often than not, remote shops have very poor answers to those questions, and as a result what they have are a number of a remote employees or contractors that just kind of mail it in.  It might be profitable if you have a good business model and do custom/enterprise software, but it's hard to build *great* product that way.

"You're missing the point of the shows you name to a certain extent. Breaking Bad isn't about exploring a wide cast of characters, it's about drilling down into the core of a select few characters with a primary focus on Walt. Characters like Hank, Marie, and Walt Jr. are really only relevant to the purpose of the show in how they affect Walt (I'd argue this is true about all characters besides Walt, but that's an argument for another time). 

Game of Thrones isn't about characters always doing the most intelligent, logical thing. If anything, it's the opposite: it's a study of the tragedies that inevitably follow from character traits (often traits that are usually seen as positive). Ned Stark's greatest fault is that he's so honest, honorable, and committed to doing his duty, he can't properly anticipate other people being treacherous and thus gets fooled and betrayed by basically everyone. Catelyn's defining trait, her desire to protect her family, leads her to make emotional choices that ultimately end up killing her husband and scattering her family. When characters aren't destroyed by their best qualities, they're torn apart time and time again by being forced to choose between two evils. 

Also, this show gets its reputation for surprising deaths due to its reliance on the viewer's awareness of narrative tropes. In a typical show, the Good Guy investigating corruption and doing the right thing would end up saving the day, or the Good King fighting a war against an unjust king would win and set the realm right. By instead showing the realistic consequences of the protagonists' actions, the show counters those implicit beliefs about how fiction should work and ends up surprising people. 

Finally, I wouldn't hold Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones up as examples of the best TV has to offer. It's certainly exciting to watch, but TV as a medium is unique because it gives the viewers the chance to get immersed in a world over a long span of time and become attached to characters over years. A TV show that makes optimal use of the advantages of the medium should offer a fully realized world with rich characters, while still creating a technically competent piece. Shows such as The Wire and Mad Men fit this mold better than shows like Breaking Bad (which has a narrower focus, though is still very good) and Game of Thrones (which often suffers from inconsistent quality and awkward dialogue). That said, if the character map of Game of Thrones is too much for you, then these kinds of shows may just not be your kind of thing. There's nothing wrong with that, but you're missing out on a rich viewing experience not possible in any other medium. ","While I will agree with you that both shows have their weaknesses, i'm not convinced, based on you viewpoint's defense, that you are up to speed on what these shows are trying to accomplish. 

I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you are reasonably young. For some reason, a lot of younger TV and Movie watchers are becoming obsessed with plot mechanics. I cannot for the life of me figure out why. 'If X is happening to my character, and character does y, and it makes no sense to me, my appreciation for the tv show has fallen.'

 This is not what pop fiction is about. 

Breaking bad was a character study of evolution and morality, a study of actions and consequences, and responsibility. Drawing connections to reality, and watching good people make bad choices is the overall point of the show. Yet you did not indicate that you even grasped the concept, instead just pointed out plot holes/character confusion.

Game of thrones is even less plot centric. The plot isn't the focal piece (it's basically been done to death) it's the study of the characters/ ideologies. You reject their behaviors because they don't fit into what you consider correct behavior. Again, if you dislike the show for this reason, this defense is weak. Part of the strength of the show is learning and reflecting on why these people do the things they do, and why they act the way they act. You may not like the way they act. You may even say this makes the show 'less believable' at which point i tune you out (what part of anything on tv is even remotely believable).

The problem with movies like 'inception' (which i only moderately enjoyed) is that it makes a lot of people look at plot complexity and logic holes as the ultimate sign of 'story' quality, when there is no story in history that is regarded as classic or 'art' because of it's plot logic. It's the other stuff that you take with you that makes it longer lasting and enduring and elevates it to a new level.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed analysis of the core themes and purposes of both Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, explaining how they go beyond just plot mechanics and focus on character development and consequences.

"Hiroshima and Nagasaki were entirely justified by the standards of the time. You're objection is also rather interesting, because you seem to be hung up on the use of nuclear weapons, when that's not even the worst thing that was done:

Hiroshima had 100,000 dead. Nagasaki is around 80,000.

Firebombing of Tokyo, using conventional weapons: 120,000.

Battle of Berlin: 200,000 dead, of which 22,000 were civilians, but where a massive number of the ""soldiers"" were actually conscripted elderly men and young boys.

Battle of Stalingrad: 1,700,000 to 2,000,000 casualties, 40,000 of which were civilians that fell to Luftwaffe air raids *in the first week.*

Rape of Nanking: Unknown, on the order of 100,000 to 300,000.

Battle of Okinawa: 120,000 soldiers killed, and 150,000 civilians killed or committed suicide, amounting to 1/4 of the local population. **Bear in mind that this happened immediately prior to the bombings, and were used as a case study as to what could happen if the US invaded the Japanese mainland.**

In addition, by this point in the war, 20,000 Chinese were dying every week under the Japanese occupation of China, which was still ongoing despite the disastrous nature of the Pacific campaign for Japan.

The fact of the matter is that Operation Downfall was something the US military wanted to avoid, particularly in the wake of Okinawa, where the civilians themselves fought off the US forces or committed mass suicide. The Japanese casualty figures for a mainland invasion were a direct extrapolation of what happened on Okinawa.

All told, 60,000,000 people (at least) died in World War II. There was significant evidence at the time that an invasion of Japan would have tacked on another 10,000,000 to 15,000,000.

In addition, the Japanese weren't going to surrender to the terms that the Allies demanded (which themselves were terms that were meant to prevent *another* world war from ever occurring). Ultimately, the bombings were a necessary event that brought an end to probably the most horrific decade our species has ever seen.

The comparison to 9/11 is also not appropriate, because the bombings were between two countries in a declared state of war, and where actual military targets were identified, and also in an era where civilian casualties were much more acceptable. In all likelihood, if we hadn't nuked the two cities, we would have obliterated them with conventional weapons. 9/11, on the other hand, was a direct attack against a target that was entirely civilian in nature, and against another target that was staffed almost entirely by civilians, and in the modern era where civilian casualties are no longer acceptable (largely due to the horrors of WWII, as well as Vietnam and Korea).","&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

The other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.

[Japan was in no mood to surrender prior to this, or even after the first bombing.](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/)

&gt; If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.

YOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.

Hiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.

&gt; Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.

Apples and oranges to compare Al-Qaeda, a rogue terrorist organization and total war between nations.

[Everybody was attacking civilian targets in WW2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II).  When nations go to war, that is what happens.

&gt; The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared.

You have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.

The Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)

&gt; “Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”

And despite all that, they still refused to surrender. At some point, you have to acknowledge that the Japanese have culpability for some of this as well.

[To single out the atomic bombings as some kind of extra-inhumane effort on behalf of the USA, is little odd, given that our conventional air raids did much more damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan)",1,1,True,Response 1 provides a detailed historical context and comparison of the casualties caused by the atomic bombings in relation to other events during World War II.

"It would greatly help if you clarified whether or not you mean adult children or child children. Child children require a different form of respect, than adult children, in order to be respectful themselves. 
I respect my father for being a provider. He didn't leave my mom, though he was a teenager when he knocked her up.

Edited for clarity","When you are a child, you literally have no understanding of how the world works. You probably don't begin to understand life until your mid 20s. As a parent you are here to guide that child into becoming a successful and independent adult. Part of that process is learning who is superior in the parent-child relationship...

The parent is providing everything for the child. Clothes, shelter, food, knowledge, protection, time, and much more. You are completely dependent on this person. This absolutely commands respect. I would be damned if the child I sacrifice everything for does not respect me.

"&gt; I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error.

There's research that shows that [many suicide attempts are impulsive](http://www.businessinsider.com/many-suicides-are-based-on-an-impulsive-decision-2014-8). Lots of people make bad decisions during times of grief and/or stress. It is *not* a rational decision, just a very strong emotional response. And that's exactly where hotlines can help these people. In that moment of pain, they are suicidal.

Your claim seems to be that only those people who have suffered for prolonged periods of time and decide to end their lives may be called suicidal. There is no way you can say that the suicidal wishes for anyone are legitimate based on how long they've suffered - what matters is intent, and often the action that follows it.

Perhaps you'd respond badly if someone just told you to ""Snap out of it"" when talking about depression. It would probably be painful and emotionally harmful. Your position regarding those who respond badly in certain situations is also invalidating the pain of whatever pushed someone to make an impulsive decision. Even if a hotline person helps them for 30 minutes it may give them time to process their feelings and arrive at a better mental state.","&gt; I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error.

The desire to die doesn't necessarily negate the fear of death, although it may push it deeper into the subconscious. It's always seemed to me that people who call suicide hotlines (the ""long-term""/legitimately suicidal people) are trying to prove themselves wrong, to find some reason or way to avoid killing themselves.  The hotline may not change any external factors, but a truly rational suicidal person would, aside from the ""research"" you mentioned, also seek out anybody who purports to be able to change his view.",2,2,True,Response 2 provides a more compelling argument by presenting evidence that many suicide attempts are impulsive and emotional decisions made during times of stress or grief.

"Are you talking about old-school punk/hardcore, or do you mean the punk/hardcore genre as a whole? You seem to be against 80's hardcore, because lots of 90's and new-school punk is very melodic music made by proficient musicians. As an example, listen to ""Pacific Standard Time"" by No Use For A Name.

But anyways, on to 80's hardcore. While the hallmark of the genre is what you described, there are lots of glaring exceptions. Bad Religion made excellent hardcore punk, yet Graffin never saw the need to shout. Instead, you'll find the singer's grandfatherly voice carrying the song with a catchy melody. If you want an example of this, listen to ""I Want to Conquer the World"".

The importance of lyrics can't be understated. The cornerstone of punk is the message. Even if you can't hear the words, you can usually figure out what the song is railing against, right? I mean, minimalist hip-hop is much the same, if my memory serves me correctly. Word-play and witty lyricism come before making any aurally pleasing backbeat. As an example, here's a little sample of a Bad Religion song ""Going through a word of sad debris/Regard quixotic reveries of ownership/The blossoming disease of man called tenure and accretion, the ancient western treadmill of deception and derision, but I want something more.""

So now we get to to the standard hardcore band. These bands are cabable of creating visceral heaviness with nothing but pure anger. Yet, they still remain accessible and catchy. Example: ""Lights Out"" by the Angry Samoans. The energy s what grabs a lot of people, as far as the genre goes. Some people just can't get enough of the quadruple-time d-beat.

For your homework, listen to ""Out of Step"" by Minor Threat. This is hardcore punk that many people will tell you is the best. I have to agree.

Some of my favorite hardcore albums:

Bad Religion - ""No Control""  
Hot Water Music - ""Fuel For The Hate Game""
Minor Threat - ""Discography"" 
Refused - ""The Shape of Punk to Come""
Husker 	Du - ""Zen Arcade""  

Check any of those out. I would almost suggest listening to more modern or 90's punk bands, as a way to be eased into the genre. NOFX and Against Me! are great places to start. You can work backwards from there. ","Punk music originated amongst people lacking traditional music training and the resources to make professional-sounding music. They were often performing for small groups of people in non-traditional venues.

That is the same as early hip-hop.

Punk music can be made by people with limited talent. But a talented (not trained, talented) guitarist, bassist, drummer and screamer can make short, fast songs that make people excited.

Early punk was only accidentally groundbreaking. Just as Brooklyn kids didn't have full bands for their parties so they used DJs, punks couldn't play well so they turned up the distortion and did the best they could.

But in time, punk evolved. It kept the short, fast and simple style, but there actually are talented singer/songerwriters in punk, as well as great (if not virtuoso) instrumentation.

Compare the DJing of early hip-hop to modern radio hits. It sounds completely different. But that is only because we've listened enough to understand the subtlety. An old fuddy-duddy might say that both Aesop Rock and Mobb Deep are both guys talking over drums and pops.

Would you think it's crazy for me to say that a Black Flag record sounds very different to me than the Misfits. It is loud, sloppy guitars and screamy lyrics, say the fuddy-duddys. True, but I know enough about sloppy guitars and screamy lyrics to know which ones I like and which I don't.

I guess the best metaphor is some people say ""if you've seen one football match, you've seen them all."" There are some similarities, for sure. People running around, kicking balls. But the more you get into football, the more you are able to enjoy it.

I'd like to give you some homework. Listen to ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" by the Ramones. It is like the ""Rapper's Delight"" of Punk. Then listen to ""Last Caress"" by the Misfits. The message of the song is that the singer wants to kill a baby, rape a mother, and kill himself.

Tell me if you think those sound similar.

"&gt;Like other left-leaning movements  

There is no ""SJW movement."" It's just a pejorative label. There is no group that self-identifies as SJWs. There is no ""SJW"" organization. No SJW leaders. No SJW conferences.  

What you view as a movement is just a bunch of independent people with similar conceptions of social justice, and they may have different views on politics, economics, etc.  

&gt;A college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.  

So...what, they shouldn't use any terms to describe certain societal phenomenons?  

Cis and trans are not hard concepts to learn, in fact they're being talked about all the time on the news thanks to people like Caitlyn Jenner. Gender spectrum isn't hard to figure out either. Spectrum is a pretty easy word. Combine that with gender, and it means exactly what it says on the tin!  

Gentrification isn't a ""SJW"" term, it's a term coined by sociologists to describe a very specific phenomenon. People who are affected by it know exactly what it is, even if they don't have a specific term to describe it. Giving it a name just makes it easier to communicate.  

Privilege is pretty easy to define. So is oppression. And identity. And assimilation. These four mean the same as their colloquial definition. Queer is something new, but it's strongly associated with gay rights so its not hard to introduce people to that term.  

Otherkin isn't something people are actually pushing for, where are you getting that from? What movement and mainstream figures are pushing for otherkin rights? None, but mentioning this term is how I can tell your view is colored too heavily by what you see and hear about ""SJWs"" on this site (I'm assuming from subreddits like /r/tumblrinaction and /r/adviceanimals).  

Institutional isn't hard either, it means exactly what it sounds like. Marginalized isn't an uncommon term either.  

**Note:** even if you don't agree that these terms accurately describe power dynamics in society, that doesn't mean the terms are bad

&gt;These are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments.  

Tumblr is just a blogging site with *more users* than reddit. A bunch of users on a social media site is not indicative of a social movement, especially if they don't even identify as such. Your view is skewed by what you see on reddit. They're a tiny, tiny, *tiny* fraction of users. They get attention because people like to go out and find stuff that offends them (ironically, just like the SJWs that are criticized!) and post it for cheap karma. Slap an outrageous quote on an image macro and you've got the attention of tens of thousands of users.

&gt;but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas  

Problem is, most people's first exposure to the idea is usually through pages dismissive of the concepts. I think that is a much bigger issue than the terms themselves. 

&gt;How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel?  

Tumblr's demographics skew pretty young, just like reddit. There's a lot of high schoolers on the site who do just fine.

&gt;or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts  

These aren't advanced-level sociological concepts. These are basic 101 terms, most of which, as I've described above, match pretty closely with their colloquial definitions. I think you're exaggerating how difficult these terms are.  

I'm not a sociologist nor have I taken any gender studies classes. Nowhere in college have I learned about these terms. If you were able to read about it on a blog, how high do you really think the barrier of entry is? Social media use is absolutely *huge* among youths today.

&gt;How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?  

Because it gives them a name to what they're experiencing. Take for example, gentrification. A poor black family is forced out of their home due to rising rent costs because of yuppies moving in. What exactly is he supposed to call that? Do you have a better term in mind?   

&gt;I don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue.  

Your view of social activists seems entirely limited to what you've seen on places like reddit. Stop and realize that what you're viewing is intentionally cherry-picked to enrage its audience.  













","Before I get started, I want to point out the problem with using the term ""SJW"" (because this *will* bite you when it comes to the other comments) - it's a pejorative with a definition that's ambiguous at best, and almost no person to whom the term is applied identifies themselves by that term.  If there's going to be a meaningful discussion in further threads, you're going to need to clarify exactly what kind of ideology you're referring to, especially considering the recent trend of infighting within progressive factions (especially feminism) leading to many points of disagreement between individuals in these movements.

In regards to the terminology, the only thing about the ""SJW"" language that makes it difficult is that it's foreign to most people.  Many of these new or newly popularized terms can be defined for easy comprehension in a single sentence, or even less.  What is ""cisgendered""?  People that aren't transgender - done.  What is ""gentrification""?  Rich neighborhoods expanding into poor ones - done.  What is ""privilege""?  The idea that you can be better off by being born into money or being white - done.  Admittedly, many progressive folks make the mistake of using these terms without taking into account their audience, but it's a problem that is very easily remedied.  And clearly it doesn't take a college education to understand these things, because many of the people advocating for this stuff are still in secondary school.",1,1,True,"Response 1 is more persuasive because it directly addresses and refutes the misconceptions and stereotypes the OP has about the so-called ""SJW movement."" It breaks down each term and explains how they are not difficult concepts to grasp, and how they actually help give a name to real-life experiences. Response 2, on the other hand, focuses more on the semantics of the term ""SJW"" and doesn't directly challenge the OP's misconceptions about the movement.",0
"A good twist is really hard to pull off, because it has to walk a very thin line. If it's too predictable, then it's not a twist at all; if it's not predictable enough, then it's just going to seem silly (e.g. If, for example, LOTR had a plot twist where Sam was actually Saruman in disguise the whole time, absolutely no one would see that coming - but that's because it's a bloody stupid idea that makes absolutely no sense).


So pulling a twist off well is a matter of feeding the audience just enough foreshadowing that they have an idea of what's coming, but not so much that they're bored when it actually happens. In other words, a good twist feeds more off suspense than surprise.


I would say that The Usual Suspects is an example of a bad twist. It's a twist that ends up invalidating a good chunk of what you've seen. In other words, it's a twist that reveals that the movie has been lying to you. 


IMHO Inception is a better twist, because it relies more on suspense than surprise. The possibility of being trapped in a dream is raised quite a few times. This sounds a few bells in the audience's mind: ""Okay, not being able to distinguish between dreams and reality seems like a major theme here, that'll probably be relevant to the plot later."" So we have a sense, a feeling, that maybe Dom is more embroiled in this world of dreams than he thinks. When we learn about what really happened with his wife, or see the top spinning at the end, it's a good twist because it's something that's been germinating in our minds for a while. We look at that and say ""Aha! I knew that would come into play somehow, I just didn't know how or when."" 


Hitchcock often spoke of the value of suspense over surprise. One of my favourite examples of this is him discussing a bombing. If you have a five minute scene where two people are having a conversation at a table, then a bomb under the table explodes, the audience is completely shocked - but only briefly. If, however, you start the scene with someone planting the bomb then sneaking out, and during the course of the conversation cut to the bomb ticking down, then the entire conversation people are on the edge of their seats. The dialogue is cast in a whole new light, knowing that there's something about to happen. Moreover, it fuses in a bit of uncertainty: Will the bomb explode? Will they find it in time? If they find it, how will they defuse it? etc.


A good twist is the same way. A twist that no one sees coming is a bad twist. Everyone's shocked when it happens - for about thirty seconds. A good twist is one that is slowly and gradually introduced, to build suspense. People are fairly certain that something will happen, but they don't know how, or why, or when. 


For example: Betrayal. You've got a film where a group of people are working to accomplish something. One of the people on the team is a traitor. A bad twist is one where, at the climax of the film, the traitor is suddenly revealed. A better twist is one where we find out part way through the movie that there's a traitor on the team, but we don't know who. This is still revealed at the end, but we spend the rest of the movie thinking ""Hmmm, okay how and why will the betrayal happen? Who will be the traitor?"" Everything is cast in the light of this knowledge that someone is going to betray the rest of the team. We may guess right, we may not, but either way (if it's a good movie) we're on the edge of our seats right up until the last minute, waiting to find out the exact circumstances of the twist we already kinda know.


tl;dr A bad twist is something that takes us by complete surprise; a good twist is one that provides new context, nuance, and depth to the rest of the movie.","Twists are done because they are intended to be a plot development or character reveal the audience would not expect to happen. A twist fails completely when it is predictable. When the story is built in a way that makes you think something is going to happen; but in fact, something you never expected occurs, you feel more engaged in the story because it is legitimately unpredictable. There's a reason twists aren't typically revealed until halfway or three quarters of the way through a movie, and that's because a twist revealed too early has no time to subvert your expectations-while one revealed too late has no legitimate impact on the rest of the story. 

No doubt some movies use twists to try to appear ""smart,"" but it has an actual purpose from a storytelling perspective in keeping things atypical. ",2,1,False,Response 1 provides a clear and concise explanation of why twists are important in storytelling and how they should be executed to be effective. It breaks down the elements of a good twist and explains why predictability is key to maintaining engagement. The example given about twists being revealed too early or too late is particularly compelling.,0
"One thing you should know is that virtually every Studio Ghibli film revolves around a coming-of-age plot. The plot throws challenges and quick change at immature characters that are unprepared for it, they must adapt and must be brave and show what's inside, their internal struggle is often emphasized.

Also every character, good or bad, has motives and development. Yubaba the bathouse owner is not evil just because, she's got a business to run. The witch of the waste is heartbroken and proud, which leads to wrath. Lady Eboshi cared about her town, employing the marginalized lepers, starting nothing short of an industrial revolution, albeit forgetting the damage to the environment. 

The braveness of characters is also rarely your macho western protagonist willing to face and slice million monsters and then self-immolate. The braveness is often displayed by vulnerable characters that have much to lose and don't have the skills or the strength to chop their way to victory, they must be cunning, firm, and rely on their (often newly made) friends if they want to succeed. 

All this combined with the art and the music, like you mentioned, makes just about every Studio Ghibli film a masterpiece.","I'm unaware of many people who rate movies based on specific criteria outside of movie critics themselves. And even then, most are willing to accept that a movie can be a gestalt, a sum greater than its parts. And even then, critics also accept the visual and spectacle of a movie as being part of whether it's good. Your analysis (or expectation of how someone else would analyze a movie) is almost all technical, which does not speak to the quality of a movie and how it can actually affect people.

So, here are a few things usually part of why Ghibili movies are considered great which also apply to western movies.

1. Visuals. Especially in an era of nearly-realistic CGI, the sheer awe of a visually stunning movie are part of what make it good. When people put Jurassic Park on their lists of best movies, it is in part because of how gorgeous the visuals were. And how that creates the important sense of wonder that drives the rest of the film. See also Gravity. Or the Lord of the Rings, which was lauded in large part for looking the way that movie should look.

2. Characterization. None of the characters are evil for the sake of evil, or lack convictions which are (at the very least) understandable. The Noh isn't malicious, just misunderstood. Now think about how often bad action movies are slammed for lacking good characterization beyond ""gritty tough hero"" and ""bad guy for no apparent reason."" That scarecrow from Howl's moving castle has more characterization without *speaking* than Tony Stark has gotten in five movies.

3. Cohesive, character-driven, plots. Benefits of having good characters is that the plots are not macguffin-driven or rely on happenstance or sins of convenience for resolution. 

4. Acting. Yep, even animated characters can act. First, they're damned expressive as characters. Second, the voice acting is top-notch.

5. Stories, both relatable to the audience and unique. Yes, it takes a bit of suspension of disbelief to believe in the world of Spirited Away, but not much more than the suspension of disbelief for the Avengers. And once that's taken care of, the story itself is relatable. A young child who irresponsibly acts, and needs to fix it? That's old-school Spielberg at his best. A man who has acted selfishly is confronted with the need to consider others (and love) and risks himself to protect others? Yes, some of them are silly, but the ones people consider among the best movies are ones which resonate.

6. Emotional impact. This comes from the characters being fleshed out and relatable, but there are none but the most hard-hearted who don't tear up at the goddamned scarecrow in Howl's moving castle. That's a more significant emotional impact *without* having to resort to ham-handed tear-jerking.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more in-depth analysis of the character development and themes present in Studio Ghibli films. It delves into the internal struggles of characters, their motives, and the unique portrayal of bravery in vulnerable characters.

"A few pros for oranges:

- Easier to travel with. Throw an orange into a dirty bag, the part you eat stays clean. Don't have a plate to put it on? The peel suffices.

- An orange is cleaner to eat. Both because of the peel, and because it naturally segments. Very hard to eat an apple without getting sticky juice all over you. I hate the feeling of sticky face and hands after eating an apple.

- Hard to make an argument about taste as preferences differ, but personally I find apples pretty boring. Citrus is more interesting to me.

To a few of your points:

&gt; Alcohol

Not really a pro for apples themselves. There are also orange liqueurs. I'd say that apples are used for alcohol more for convenience historically, and now tradition, rather than any inherent advantage. Somewhere in Africa there is liquor made by the tribe's women all chewing up some plant matter and spitting it into a big pot to ferment (really, I swear, I saw it on an odd food show). That's not really a benefit to spit.

&gt; Food

An orange pie seems possible, it's just that other citrus works slightly better for it (key lime pie...) 

&gt; Diversity

Perhaps the original form of the orange is better to begin with, so there's less need to create many variations. Also, if wide variations are allowed, I'd get to include many other types of citrus as benefits to oranges. A lemon, lime, grapefruit, pomelo etc are likely about as similar to oranges as the many breeds of apples are to each other, right? (cue biologist to tell me how wrong we are)

&gt; Pop culture

Apple benefited from a recognizable icon, but given their neat technology, probably could have been just as successful as ""orange."" Unfortunately that wouldn't roll off the tongue quite so well, and the Macintosh pun would be lost... But blame whoever wrote the dictionary, not the noble orange.","Born in Brazil and raised in Florida.  Apples SUCK.  Steve Jobs saw the apple, realized that it was just terrible, and improved on it, making the Apple II.  It was easy to improve on the apple -- Steve Jobs chose it because it was low-hanging fruit.  From there Apple has come up with more and more products far superior to the original apples, the crab variety of which were written about by Shakespeare as being the food of poverty.

Have you ever driven by a field and smelled delicious apple blossoms?  No?  That's because apple blossoms don't smell like anything.  Orange blossoms, on the other hand?  Better than fucking JASMINE.

You know what happens if you bring apples on a long sea voyage?  You get scurvy.  Even if the apples *don't* rot, you still get scurvy.  Oranges, on the other hand, are the juicy hallmark of summer.  Juicy, sweet, and delicious.  Apples aren't juicy.  They get brown as soon as you cut them.  They suck at being tasty, too.

Oh, and have you ever had apple juice or apple cider?  This is how you know that our cultural ancestors were the British.  They didn't have any food on their island, so they had to make do with this apple shit.  And it was so bad that the only thing they could do was press it into cider.  Apple juice, on the other hand, is fake.  There's no juice in an apple.  Squeeze as much as you want.  There isn't any.  It just tastes like drinking candy, anyway.  Candy is not a drink.  Candy is a food.  Orange juice is a drink.

But there's a secret, hidden reason why you don't eat oranges: because oranges only grow in cool places.  Cool as in awesome, not cool as in temperature.  They actually *don't* grow in places with cool temperatures.  But they grow in tropical climates.  British people don't.  Most American people don't either.  That's why these people generally suck.  Because they don't grow in the same places that oranges do.  (I did grow up in places with oranges, so I speak from a position of moral authority here.)

You know why there are 7000 varieties of apples?  Because every farmer thinks *he* will be the one to finally make the apple palatable.  Nope.  Still sucks.  Cyanide in the core and everything.

The quintessentially American apple pie?  GERMAN.  That shit is GERMAN.  And it's not even good.  I'll take a citrus pie over an apple pie any day, whether it's lemon meringue or key lime.  Or Meyer lemons.  Or tangerines.  Blood oranges.  Now, there are some fucking terrible citrus fruits out there.  The grapefruit.  The pomelo.  The ugli (it has a cool name but a horrid taste).  The Buddha's hand.  The citron.  The etrog.  The whatever the hell that light brown thing from Israel is that a friend smuggled in a few years ago.  But all these awful citrus fruits only serve to highlight the beauty of the orange.

Now, let it not be said that I'm biased.  I think tangerines are better than oranges.  But apples?  Seriously?  Nope.  Nope nope nope.  Fuck apples.

But not literally because you'll hurt yourself on them, since they suck so much.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more structured and logical argument in favor of oranges. The points made are clear, concise, and directly address the issues raised in the original post. The focus on practicality, cleanliness, and personal preference for taste makes a stronger case for oranges compared to the emotional and exaggerated arguments in Response 1.",0
"Your knowledge of the systematic racism in this country is elementary at best. Maybe after a few more years living here and understanding the nuance you will have a better grasp of it.

"I grew up solidly in the participation award era of the 90's.

Know what? It didn't really teach me that I win no matter what.

Because the participation trophy's sucked.  1st palce? Huge awesome trophy.  2nd and 3rd? Cool medium sized trophies.  Shit you could be proud of.

The rest of us? These junky little trinkets that paled in comparison.

&gt;  This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.

And we wanted the big trophy. Getting a little concilation trophy didn't remove that desire to win.

&gt; I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why? 

Why not? At least you showed up and played.  That's all the that trophy is.  It doesn't say ""Congratulations, you won!"" it says ""Yep, you played this year.""  I don't see what's wrong with a commemorative trophy for that.  It's not a winners trophy.

&gt; Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize.

How about rewarding someone for showing up when they could have easily not done anything at all?

It's a lot easier to stay at home and play video games and watch TV and not do anything at all. All the participation trophy does is say that you competed.  What's so bad about that?

It's not without precedence either.

All Olympic Athletes receive a participation medal for qualifying.

&gt; Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up?

That winners get big ass trophy's and losers get something that says they showed up? What's bad about that?

&gt; We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? 

Except reality is that hard work doesn't always translate to just rewards.  You can work super hard at McDonalds and you'll still make the same $7.25 as Super Slacker Steve.","I don't really have enough time to skim through all the comments at the moment, but even seeing your second edit, I don't understand why you are under the impression that getting a lesser trophy than the winners teaches you that losing is okay..

Anyone who played organized sports, but got a participation trophy, was *never*, and I mean, *never* happy about it. I played about every sport possible for the entirety of my childhood, and never saw anyone like this.

You want what the big kids got. The good trophy. 

Honestly, if anything, getting that small trophy or plaque is a constant reminder that you *didn't* win, and should serve as more motivation.

This argument reframes the purpose of participation trophies as a form of acknowledgment rather than a reward for losing.",0
"Suppose an old man lies on his deathbed, and you are his estranged son. As he lies dying, he apologizes for the issue that has caused a rift between you, and asks for your forgiveness. No matter what he says, though, you can't really find it in your heart to give it to him. So do you lie and tell him you forgive him, or do you tell him the truth and make his final moments painful?

Consider another situation. The prime minister of a nation is the best they have every seen. Under his leadership, the wealth gap between the rich and the poor has decreased; democracy has flourished from the ruins of the previous dictatorship; GDP has increased dramatically, and foreign investments are pouring in. You are his secretary, and one day you accidentally walk in on him having sex with another man, who you recognize as another member of the government he has close ties with. The people in your country are socially conservative, and the knowledge that he has sex with men and is cheating on his wife would ruin him. One day, a reporter comes up to and says that she has suspicions of just this. Do you answer her honestly?

I think it's naive to say truth is the *only* thing that every matters about a statement. Honesty is a good policy because we cannot function without trust. But truth functions as a weapon just as much as misinformation. It is a true fact that black people have lower IQs than white people. Stating this fact without context (the fact that IQ correlates with environment and social class, the subsequent discussion about why African Americans tend to be in a lower social class due to the effects of American history and why this is almost certainly not genetic, the fact that IQ tests are biased in favor of the life experiences of the writers, the fact that a reverse Pygmalion effect exists racially, the fact that race as we use it is a social construct and that generalizations over race are basically meaningless the way most people use them, and so on) ends up having a sociopolitical effect anyway. Rather than explain why the fact does not imply what most people think it implies, I would rather not state the fact in the first place because facts don't exist in a vacuum. I wouldn't lie about it- but I wouldn't bring it up unless I knew my audience would understand it correctly.

The truth is important. The problem is that the truth is wrapped up in a web of theory, and the wrong truths to the wrong theories will lead to people holding harmful views. ","&gt;What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. 

I think I agree mostly, but the way humans tend to process generalized information, unless you're very precise with the idea you run the risk of, by holding a true and honest idea in your mind, carrying and perpetuating a false *impression* resulting from that idea. Let's take your proposed example for analysis:

&gt;Here is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people. It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes.

It's *only* noticeable at the extremes. In the NFL, for example, 68% of players are black vs. 17% of the U.S. population. At the collegiate level black athletes are about 45% of the player population, and at the high school level the ratios are even less skewed.

In other sports, however, it's not really as clear or precise as you say. For example, Kenyans (specifically a particular tribe of Kenyans) dominate marathons, but you don't see them dominating in the NFL, do you? Or look in international football (soccer) competitions... the German world cup team (a bunch of whiteys) has done pretty well over the years, with tons of championships. Other national teams have also shown excellence, despite a lack of black athletes. The phrase ""less athletic"" is such a coarse generalization that it might give you the impression that white players cannot be competitive at the highest level, or that in the median competitive range (where most actual people would exist) that it's not close enough as to be ignorable. By perpetuating that unqualified general idea (even if in some sense correct) you're risking perpetuating a lot of related specific ideas that are false.

And for ideas that are *false*, don't you think that a false idea that causes suffering is worse than a false idea that causes no suffering or at least causes less suffering? If so, then presenting a true general idea that carries with it associated false and harmful ideas, should be undertaken much more cautiously than a true general idea that has little associated downside, shouldn't it?",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced argument about the importance of being precise with ideas and the potential harm that can come from perpetuating false impressions, even if the core idea is true. This response also addresses the potential consequences of spreading true ideas that can lead to harmful beliefs.

"Your title and your conjecture say slightly different things. One saying that the goal (end game) of life is to reduce material wants. The other saying that you reduce material wants to obtain a more peaceful life.

I would argue that 
1) there is no ""goal"" in life 
2) a peaceful life is not one that is better

1) The only result of life is death, no matter what moves you make during life, the result is always the same. If you become enlightened before you die, if you become a millionaire before you die, if you climb the worlds tallest mountain before you die, nothing changes about the end result. A goal in itself, would just be one additional ""want"", and nothing more.

2) A peaceful life, would be one without disturbance. This means a life without change, a life without stimulus. The more stimulus and change there are the more chaotic the life and less peaceful it becomes. The state with the least change and stimulus is death, the opposite of life. 

And a want is hardly a quantifiable thing. I want one thing: absolute happiness. How many other wants are going to be piled into making that one want happen? Even if you want a small quantified able thing say a cup of tea in the morning, there are other wants that need to be met to reach that, such as living in a place were tea is available. And then what about when that cup of tea is consumed, do we simply slip into a catatonic state until the desire for the next cup of tea arises?

Wants drive us, and give us purpose. Less wants may in fact make us more peaceful, but I don't think that is necessarily an ideal state.","What about material desires that drive life aspiration.

This means healthy food, access to things that promote good health.  I need to read news/books/ things to stay up to date and relevant to support the continuous growth of my charity.

"The problem with putting MLK on the twenty dollar bill is that he already gets a disproportionate amount of the recognition and honor in the historical memory. I'm not saying that he doesn't deserve all the statues and holidays - he probably does - what I'm saying is that so many other people deserve a comparative amount of recognition.  Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, WEB Dubious, Booker T Washington, Ida B. Wells, A. Phillip Randolph, James  Baldwin, Langston Hughes, Nora Zeale Hurston, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Diane Nash, John Lewis, Medgar Evers, Bayard Rustin and a 1000 others all deserve recognition for their efforts in creating a freer America. 

Yet, it's always King we shine the spotlight. He already has monument on the national mall, a federal holiday, and [700 streets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streets_named_after_Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.) named after him. Compare this to Douglass, probably King's most worthy competitor in most awesome orator/ in US history, who has like [four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Frederick_Douglass#Streets_and_bridges) streets *and* bridges named after him. Even if wikipedia is severely undercounting, it is still illustrative of this point. 

By compacting the long march for freedom into one man, w've turned MLK into a mixture of a puppy dog and Jesus. He comforts us about America's trajectory on issues of racism. His memory assures us that the American Dream is not a lie for black people. That the promissory note has been cashed. In the popular memory, the United States had a problem with racism until MLK came and cleansed the America soul with his works and his sacrifice. By flattening the entire story down to one man, we not only forget the thousands (hundreds-of-thousands) other people who fought for civil rights from the founding of the country up until today. By erasing them from memory, we also erase the fact that so many people were needed to change the country. That our country was born with a cancer.

Finally, honoring MLK is kind of a slap in the face to the man. Towards the end of his life he was fighting hard for so that the poor would have better access to wealth. I don’t want to die and have to tell MLK ""millions of people still don't have money, but at least it's money with your face on it. ㅠㅠ""

Are we going for people of the best moral character, or the people with the most inspiring personal stories? Are we going for people whose story everyone already knows, or could we maybe use currency to spotlight heroes who don't get quite as much attention? Or should we just choose the best-looking historical figures?

I'm not sure that ""impact"" or ""number of people helped"" should necessarily be the sole metric by which we choose people for currency. I'm not going to argue that Harriet Tubman had more of an impact on US history than MLK Jr., but I don't think that's the be-all and end-all of the discussion. I think there's something to be said for choosing someone who doesn't already have a holiday and a monument on the National Mall. And while MLK is certainly more impressive than the vast majority of figures out there, I think Tubman still has a more awe-inspiring personal story--she may have had less of an impact, but she also started as a slave. That's kickass. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced argument against putting MLK on the twenty dollar bill. It highlights the issue of disproportionate recognition and honor given to MLK compared to other important figures in history who also deserve recognition. It also delves into the danger of simplifying the civil rights movement to just one man, erasing the contributions of many others. This response also brings up the point that honoring MLK in this way may not align with his values and goals.

"Others have already said a lot about this, so I'll leave you with [this](http://mikerugnetta.tumblr.com/post/123744373585/op-onions-pretty-disappointed-with-idea-channel), a really, really good post on why ""egalitarianism"" has come to be at odds with feminism and why feminism embodies the ideals of egalitarianism way, way better than egalitarianism does.

It's also worth pointing out that the ""feminazis"" (god, I hate that term) often have something resembling a point. I'm no fan of the Gawker-network callout culture that's become somewhat of a normalized force in internet discussions today, but I think that most of the internet's disdain of feminism comes from a caricatural portrayal brought about by cherry-picking examples of poorly-manifested attempts at feminism. I think it's valuable, next time you see a ""feminazi"" post, to look carefully at the source material and realize that, however acerbic or acidic the post might be, the author's coming from a legitimate place of pain much of the time, a place which unfortunately informs the tone of the piece.

Feminism as a movement is great. It tackles head-on many uncomfortable questions about inequality between genders that are reinforced thanks to vicious cycles and socialization, and if people who are benefiting from that inequality (myself included) are angry that people are calling them to think more critically about the advantages they've been handed, then so be it. I think there are some people who get turned off by the overwhelming minority of people who embody the movement poorly, but I think that more people get turned off by other men who already have a disdain for the movement - a disdain that will not be changed easily, especially by re-terming the movement.

I think that, in the end, there's a quote I'll paraphrase that I can't remember off the top of my head that describes the need for the term to stick around: in any article discussing feminism, the vitriol of the comments section validates the movement's need to exist. It's got power under its current name, even if many people wouldn't like to admit it, and as long as it continues to gather steam there's no reason to change it to another name dominated, as the Rugnetta post shows, by straight white men.","I think we just need to make the feminist organizations that are more egalitarian prominent. I personally have been doing research and haven't really found any, which doesn't mean they don't exist, but they should be brought out and heard. And if they don't exist, a group should be created. Media puts too much focus on the extremists in feminism, and that gives everyone a negative view of the word. I wish we heard more from feminist egalitarian organizations, or leaders too. Especially during times when the media starts showing all the extreme feminists doing things that are disrespectful and people start calling them feminazis. Then we could be like ""hey yeah, we know they're the extremists, but here are those of us that support equal rights.""",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of why feminism embodies the ideals of egalitarianism better than the term ""egalitarianism"" itself. It addresses common misconceptions about feminism, acknowledges the legitimate pain behind some extreme feminist viewpoints, and emphasizes the importance of the movement in addressing gender inequality. Response 2, on the other hand, focuses more on the need for more prominent feminist organizations that are more egalitarian without delving into the deeper reasons why feminism is important.",0
"can you give me an example of any card game that treated those who purchased no-cards vs. those who purchased a lot of cards equally?

I have never recieved a new pack of YGO-cards because I won against an opponent 10 times, I had to go to the store, buy a new pack and hope for the best.

If I didn't expand my library than that meant I was stuck with all the strategies I currently had.

Of course payers will have an edge and there is nothing wrong with that. That is the nature of CCG/TCG's.

If you want some solace though, it all comes back to the time vs. value conversation.

If your time is more worth to you than your money, you are more likely to spend some bucks for progress than the other way around.

A meta will always get figured out, and grow stale. The solution is an expansion. It shakes up the meta and throws a bunch of new strategies at players. Playing around a new expansion drop is probably the most fun time to play the game.


The game does benefit paying players in constructed a lot, but it's still a much more customer friendly than any traditional card game (Again, like MTG). I think it's awesome that it's entirely possible to play the game without monetary investment.

"The difference is whether rules are a starting point, or a result.

Prescriptivism is looked down upon in Linguistic circles because it is the linguistic equivalent of Begging the Question, because the goal, as Linguists see it, is to *find* the rules that govern language.

To draw an analogy from physics, consider what happened when the first few dozen scientists produced data that contradicted the Newtonian Model of physics. 

A Prescriptivist would look at data (reliable, reproducible data, collected from the real world), and declare that they are, by definition, wrong because they don't fit within the Newtonian model, and therefore the Data should align itself with the Model.

The Descriptivist looks at the data, then turns around to say that their *model* must be wrong, and that we need to find a new model, because the data indicates that it isn't quite right, and we need to create a model that fits the (real world, reliable, reproducible) data.  Thus we get Relativistic Physics.

The proper ~~deterministic~~ descriptivistic response to ""Shops went the he to"" would be to say ""Wait a second, that flies in the face of everything we know.  Is the source reliable?  Can the results be duplicated?""  Without sufficient data, it'll likely be rejected as ""random noise,""  because without agreement of acceptability from a community of cognitively normal, native speakers, it's not describing *language* but describing a *sentence.*

Heck, the very techniques to determine the rules rely on include things like ""In this dialect, construction X is valid, but construction Y isn't,""  because without such a test, you cannot determine whether you have correctly described the rules of that dialect.","As far as I know, the difference between prescriptivism and descriptivism is that the former consider rules as the source of correctness, and the later consider usage as the source of correctness.  The difference is not over something like “Shops went the he to” that nobody will say. The difference is over some structures and meaning that are commonly used and that prescriptivists will reject because their rules are not followed or the meaning is not the one deducible from etymology, or that are in practice not commonly used but that prescriptivists will try to impose because it fit in their preferred framework.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation using analogies and examples to illustrate the difference between prescriptivism and descriptivism.

"&gt;I feel homophobia is a symptom of more deeply entrenched personal traits

&gt;I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate other groups of people they have never met or gotten to know. 

This is not true, in most cases people's biases are derived from the society and friends/family they grew up with. 

People don't have 'hate' within them that they have to release and just choose different groups of people to be their victims. An individual can be completely nice towards everyone except one group of people and that could be because of what he/she was taught by their family or learnt from the society they grew up in.

I don't believe that people hate just for the sake of hating, there are always reasons behind the way you feel towards some one/group and they are usually 'case-by-case'","&gt;willingness to hate other groups of people they have never met or gotten to know

Unfortunately that is just a very human, universal bias. It is easy to fear or even hate the unknown or different. 

Every humans experiences this bias.

What differentiates people is the ability to DEAL with that emotion. Logical, rational people can overcome this bias.

If anything, Ex-homophobes has demonstrated this ability, so you know they are capable of logically defeating their own bias.

"I am as Socialist as the 14 work-day is long. The type of Socialist that has a picture of Eugene Debs in a frame-level of commitment to the cause. So I get what you are coming from in your belief system.

Remember, however, that those the shout the loudest on both the left and the right are the ones in the minority.  If they were the majority, they wouldn't need to shout.  The extreme minority always shouts the loudest, like the bleating of a sheep against the rain and winds of nature herself.

Many people on the left and right, especially on the far out fringes, have a need to out-liberal or out-conservative those around them.  I'm more ""this"" (PC, Worker's Rights, Pro-Christ, whatever...) than you, and that makes me to superior to you.  Those people are not rational in the sense that you can change their views, because their views will change - but only to the next extreme position on the political spectrum when it becomes the cause de jour for their political affiliation.

To put that into context, you see extreme liberals screaming about about trans-gendered rights because their most recent cause, Gay Rights, has ended.  But you see none of them arguing for polygamy, which is surprising as that is a very logical leap and follows the much the same philosophical arguments as the Gay Marriage movement.  But polygamy isn't on their radar because it's not ""cool"" yet.  Perhaps it'll be cool in a couple of years - then it's all about the megaphone and how they were on the issue first, long before their fellow liberals saw the injustice on behalf of ""Group P"" they have a reason to rally for.

The echo chamber of intelligent debate that is social media like twitter and facebook forces the conversation into shock tactic-like statements designed to be heard over then din of other tweets that support the same thing but are not written by those that need to be right/better than those around them.

The world is indeed a strange place out on the fringes of the political spectrum, and while I reside here, I tend not to talk to my neighbors because they aren't too neighborly.  They want to out-liberal me in a contest of PC-ness and other things that are frankly, dehumanizing towards all of humanity.

Reducing people from society into roles, like ""white"", ""black"", ""gay"", conservative"", allows for people to separate individuals from the group of humanity, and demand that we treat everyone in group ""A"" as equals.  That's all well and good if you are group ""A"", but what about group ""X""?  Most educated people on the extremes of the left find that the ""Throw a Brick Through a McDonald's Window to Protest the WTO"" aren't wrong, they're just assholes.

And, literally like assholes, they don't really think through their shit - they just try to get it out as quickly as possible while giving them the most comfortable result that allows them to feel better.

Also, fuck the IMF, amiright?  Oh, sorry - the IMF was *so* the 2006 issue for the liberals.","&gt;I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders.*I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.*

One of these things is not like the others.  (100% with you on those first four, btw). And herein lies the problem that you're talking about.  *Why* do you believe them, despite having only heresay and no solid evidence to rely on?  

Because you've conflated the idea of their victimhood with your own open-minded liberalness.  You think that to question them would be to reject your *political* beliefs.   That not taking them for their word would betray your principles.   This is an ideological response; and psychologically speaking it is very similar to the reaction religiously devout people have to something that violates the rules of their religion (Such as why so many Christians are mad that gay marriage is now legal).   

In reality, though without doubt it is highly likely that at least *some* of those women are telling the truth, you and I cannot possibly know that, and so to say that you ""absolutely"" believe *all* of them reflects that you *absolutely* do not want anyone to question where you stand on that issue, lest they challenge your ideological purity/sincerity, or worse: Accuse you of being a bigot.  You aren't just a bad person for not sharing their views, You don't share their views *because you're a bad person*.   There are remarkable parallels between the radical left and the religious fundamentalist in this regard.  

That's the problem: It's ideological.   Not rational, not even about what's right or wrong.  Political extremism is about ""US"" vs ""Them"".  And ideological purity is expected by radicals.   Social pressure deters people from questioning, criticizing, or disagreeing.    To suggest that maybe we should wait until we know the facts before judging is tantamount to being a rape apologist and a misogynist to the far-left crowd.    

Then there's the media.   Washington Post, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, etc.   These publications primarily generate readership by pandering to those extremists.   Washington Post is to Liberalism what Jezebel is to women's equality.   

I won't even get into the tumblr/twitter ""opression olympics""  (as a gay man, I am allowed to have *some* opinions, but they're not as valid as say, a gay *woman*, because she is by virtue of being female more oppressed than me, etc.)  

Ideological extremism ceases to be about justice, or right and wrong, or even the *truth*.   In radical politics, the truth will always be viewed through the funhouse mirror of the ideologue.  

The key is to step back from the labels, and from what you've been *told* to believe, and just start thinking about the foundational goals of social justice.   That everyone should have equal standing under the law, equal opportunities and equal protections within our society.   That the horrors and injustices of history ( and the present day) must be stopped, and the damage done corrected as much as this can possibly be done.     

We have to get away from ideology and indoctrination, and encourage people to use their brains.   Then it will become apparent who really wants a better world, and who is just looking out for their own selfish desires.

"The United States is a nation of 50 states, all with different cultural backgrounds, but we're all American. The Pledge of Allegiance works as a way to remind all Americans that they are American, regardless of politics, religion, or state.
  
Lincoln's quote ""united we stand, divided we fall"" is as true today as it was when he said it, and the last time I felt this was on 9/11. Only a few months before, the US was divided. The Bush v Gore race was one of the closest, most contentious presidential races in US history. Extremists on both sides fanned the flames of cultural separation. Liberals saw conservatives as brain-dead ignorant hicks, and conservatives saw liberals as anti-American elitist hippies. The contention between the two was ramping up. I was 22 in 2001. I was in the Gore camp. I didn't like Bush, or the neoconservative platform. I had also never been to New York, though I was dating a woman who was from there.
  
When 9/11 happened, the news originally broadcasted people falling from the towers. I remember seeing people die on my TV, on every single channel, and it made me angry. It made us all angry. Those were not New Yorkers falling, those were Americans. My countrymen and women. And the rest of the country felt the same way. It didn't matter where you're from, what state, city, backwoods, whatever, we were angry because The United States of America was being attacked. We might bicker and fight, but god help you if you ever attack us.
  
I personally feel that the pledge of allegiance is still necessary, now more than ever, because the US is one big dysfunctional family. We need reminders that show us that at the end of the day we're all Americans.","Are they actually effective?

The pledge of allegiance, in particular, seems utterly counterproductive. Children start reciting it before they can have any idea what these fancy, archaic words mean -- maybe ""liberty and justice for all"" might have some meaning, but ""indivisible""? Or ""republic""? And even ""liberty and justice for all"" is going to sound more than a little abstract to a kid who will rarely feel the liberty to refuse reciting this ritual.

But even that is assuming too much. It's said so often that it loses all meaning, to the point where it's so *boring* to these kids that they start inventing [alternate pledges](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2009/10/22) just to pass the time.

I think it's similar to religion in Europe. Unlike the US, many European countries have no legal notion of separation of church and state -- several have actual, official state religions, like the Church of England. And those countries all have far less religiosity than the US, with nonbelief (or at least apathy) rising as high as 50%.

Which should come as no surprise. When the Church could torture or kill you for heresy, they could actually force people to fall into line. But the status of the Church of England has become largely ceremonial. At worst, students are forced to be educated about religion, but it's actual education (and not just indoctrination). So the Church becomes at best a stodgy old bit of the government, and nobody likes the government anyway. At worst, it's a reminder of past atrocities committed in its name.

I think the Pledge of Allegiance is similar -- at best, it's said so often it means nothing, which makes it just another stupid boring waste of time imposed by school. At worst, if you actually educate students about the history of this country, it's just a [reminder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny) of [past atrocities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears) committed [in its name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soiling_of_Old_Glory).

I'm not saying we should keep it. I'm just saying that today, it's ineffective at best, and might actually be counterproductive.

It only really becomes problematic when you pair it with [ineffective, dishonest education](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/16/texas-schools-rewrites-us-history), but I think that's a separate problem -- if your ""history"" class promotes god and guns and minimizes the slave trade and the Enlightenment influence to the point of practically pretending Thomas Jefferson didn't exist, then you don't need the Pledge of Allegiance. If anything, the Pledge might run counter to that agenda if you paid attention to the bit about ""indivisible"" or ""liberty and justice for all"".",2,2,True,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it appeals to the emotional aspect of unity and shared identity as Americans, especially in times of crisis like 9/11. It emphasizes the importance of the Pledge of Allegiance in reminding people of their common nationality and unity, despite differences in politics, religion, or state.",0
"There's evidence that shows that spanking, and corporal punishment in general, is related to slower cognitive development of children. [This study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=250684) shows that those children who were not spanked gained over 5 more points (on a 100-point scale) compared with those children who were spanked.

That's not all, of course. It's known that children who are spanked and harshly disciplined are more likely to show signs of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

But let's move away from the studies for a moment. You should certainly read [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201309/research-spanking-it-s-bad-all-kids) from Psychology Today that talks about the issue in detail. Spanking is bad in many ways: It decreases the level of trust that a child feels for a parent, it doesn't increase desirable behaviour, and this is true regardless of ethnicity or culture. There are also some resources at the bottom of the page that you may find useful /u/halpalalpa.

edit: formatting.
",Spanking kids only teaches them that if they do something authority doesn't like they'll get spanked. It doesn't teach reason or value as to *why* what they did was wrong. And once the kid learns to toughen up and accept getting spanked then what? Are you just gonna keep spanking them harder? The only way to guarantee a kid won't do something again is if they become aware of the feelings of others and *why* what they did was bad.,2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more comprehensive argument against spanking by presenting evidence from studies, as well as insights from Psychology Today.

This well-rounded approach is likely to be more persuasive in changing the OP's view on spanking.",0
"If we are to take something like Dunbar's Number seriously, that is, to assume there is a physical limit of our ability to understand the social connections between people known to the individual, then it follows that other socially-dependent concepts, like empathy and compassion, also have their limits, in that they can only be applied in their totality to a limited number of things. You are physically incapable of understanding and having compassion for *every single living thing*, rather, in order to have the compassion of the type you've defined, the individual must create for themselves an idea or representation that stands in place for that complete understanding. They must substitute what they do understand, which in this case is the ""love"" they have for themselves and those they do know, to fill in gaps for what they are incapable of understanding.

What that means is that the person who is feeling compassion for all living things, as a matter of physiology, is in fact *not* doing such, as much as they are creating a heuristic for ""compassionate"" behavior. They love *the idea of ""all living things""* because they cannot understand what ""all living things"" actually represents, much less have feelings for. This process is wholly dependent on the ego - a lack of self concept means lacking the ability to do that substitution.

However, that leaves unanswered the question of whether a temporary suspension of the ego is necessary to create an effective heuristic for compassionate behavior. I argue ""no"". There is nothing to suggest, on a conceptual level, that the forming of such a pattern of behavior necessitates experiencing something like the ""ego death"" often attributed (though not exclusive) to LSD, Ayahuasca, dissociatives, etc.  It would seem to be the case that a supreme ego is necessary, one which is able to substitute for a lack of knowledge of others the knowledge of itself, and act as though it were interacting with a being of the same makeup. Temporary suspension may be *helpful*, but you haven't demonstrated any reason for thinking one is incapable of doing this kind of ""ego substitution"" without this experience. Rather, one could be a kind of narcissist/solipsist who believes all people are them, and exhibit the same behavior for which your view seems to aim.","But why do you believe this?

It doesn't exactly seem well founded or explained in your post.

Why can a person who hasn't experienced egolessness be truly compassionate?

Thus they are able to lower costs, gain a competitive advantage, and export more.  That's why you get huge companies like Boeing, GM, GE, Google, and Facebook which are very successful around the world.  They were able to develop to achieve scale domestically, then export to the rest of the world.  So the high population is a net good thing for the US economy.

"That is literally not what socialist feminism is. Or at least that's not what Marxist feminism is. Marxist feminism asserts that women were made subservient to men, by men, for the interests of capitalism, and that the oppression is so tied to capitalism that, even if you somehow eliminated it, you'd still have oppression along other lines (race, sexuality, etc) that would potentially be worse than before. Therefore dismantling capitalism is the only way to end oppression.

Among the left, the idea that women's oppression is solely derived from biology is an idea pretty much only believed by trans exclusionary radical feminists, a particularly small and terrible movement. Heck, in early hunter gatherer tribes, gatherers, who were mostly if not entirely women, provided upwards of 80% of the food.","&gt;Due to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work = more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women.

Well, more work does not necessarily mean more money.  Especially when womens' participation [tends to be undervalued relative to its importance for success](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-and-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html?_r=0).  Although you've listed a number of reasons that women might be expected to add less value, you're falling victim to the problem noted in the above link.

&gt;When more women lead, performance improves. Start-ups led by women are [more likely to succeed](http://www.dowjones.com/collateral/files/womenpe_report_final.pdf); innovative firms with more women in top management are [more profitable](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.1955/abstract); and companies with more gender diversity [have more](http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/2/208.short) revenue, customers, market share and profits. [A comprehensive analysis](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-15222-001/) of 95 studies on gender differences showed that when it comes to leadership skills, although men are more confident, women are more competent.

Womens' lower earnings cannot be explained as the result of differences in biological or psychological capacity.  If such factors explained the difference in pay, we would expect to see higher pay for women in leadership roles than for men - after all, it looks like they're objectively better at it.

"I think work experience is valuable and would strongly encourage it much in the same way.  That said, there are plenty of kids out there who are internally motivated and super disciplined.  School *or* work, they'll excel.

If we're talking about someone who has career ambitions that require college, it's arguably better for them to maximize their chances of success within that framework by focusing on advanced studies in HS to get into a better school that is paid for.  If you can save up some money,  but ""make"" more money in scholarships, that's better in the long-run for most college students.

There's just not enough of an attrition rate in college for me to look at your experience and decide that's a basis for teaching a series of life lessons that can come about through a myriad of contexts.  Playing competitive sports can teach leadership, diplomacy, and humility (when you lose and learn from it.)  Shucks, so can school if you parent in that direction.

The primary reason to get a job in HS is to save up money and garner a little financial independence. If there's a reason to encourage it, that's the reason, and it *can* be outweighed by kids who demonstrate a higher probability of doing well in school to the point where it pays dividends.

EDIT:  I worked in HS and in college.  I think the kids who had the free time to devote to school excelled in some part because they had the extra time to devote to memorization and practice.  I did well too but I know plenty of people who would not have made it if they had to juggle these things and it just seems silly to make it an artificial priority.","&gt; I was a spoiled lazy kid because I never got a job.

"You answered your own debate... *""Suck it up, if you want to learn history, watch a documentary.*

But to address some of your points: If you want to see a ""proper film"" about Pearl Harbor, watch *Tora! Tora! Tora!*. That movie is so factually correct that the 'historical accuracy' debates are mostly about the obvious bits (American carriers had to pretend to be Japanese ones, since the Japanese ones were on the bottom of the ocean), and some less obvious bits about which particular sub-model of aircraft was (or sometimes should have been) used as the basis for mocked up models used in the film. (That's why Michael Bay felt the need to go so far beyond the actual facts, he was trying to separate his film from the others, mainly from this one.)

But what happens in a case like this? You have a movie that's based on a true story, uses two different books as its foundation, was made with countless technical advisors, the stories of numerous American and Japanese battle participants, the full cooperation of the military to collaborate on complex (and massive) ship and aircraft movements... the works... and they still made mistakes. At what point is a production designer saying ""This engine cowling looks cooler"" different from a scriptwriter saying ""This battle seems cooler""? And what about information that remained classified in 1970 that's come to light since? Should we retroactively ban films?

What happens when it's something like *Braveheart*, where certain facts are (and will remain forever) unknown? Is that story simply off-limits for all time (or until we build a time machine)?

""Based on a true story"" does not mean (and has never meant) historical accuracy. It means ""We didn't come up with the basis for this story, and we've paid someone for the rights to use *their* story as the basis for our film instead"". Notice the difference in the disclaimers at the beginning of most films ('Based on a true story' flashing onscreen for a few seconds) compared to *Tora! Tora! Tora!* (which takes like 3 minutes to go over their attempts at accuracy).

I think the larger failing in your primary example isn't that ""historical fiction"" about the Cold War was used as the basis for your History class, it's that education should be less about dumping information into student's heads, and more about teaching them to acquire and critically evaluate the information they do receive.","I sympathize with your frustrations, but I'm not sure I agree we need to start banning movies. A few points:



&gt; It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.

Actually, it really should. In any capacity. We should not be in the business of encouraging people to swallow stories wholesale, whether they find them in the theater, on the internet, in a book, or in the paper. If you are endeavouring to discover the ""true story"", you should already be looking at multiple sources. This isn't even a difficult thing to do - you managed to do it with a quick wikipedia search.



&gt;People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can).

How someone interprets the word ""based"" is not the responsibility of the filmmaker. All the simulacrum in the world does not change basic definitions.



&gt; If you want to learn history, want a documentary.

While it's true that documentaries are often held to a higher standard than historical films, this does not make them infallible. A lot of what passes under the genre of ""documentary"" is heavily biased, or even outright doctored. Films do you the courtesy of letting you know they are fabricated, whereas any fabrication in documentaries is presented as unvarnished truth. Should we ban documentaries too?  



&gt;""We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson"".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?

Because people are interested in history, but they are also interested in the human condition, and how people relate to one another. Sometimes, they would prefer this to historical accuracy. Pearl Harbour's main purpose was to tell a story of love in a time of war - the focus was on human drama, and not historical accuracy. It's perfectly fine to criticize them about this, but why would you get outraged over Bruckheimer being honest about his intentions? He *should* be coming forward to clarify that history is his backdrop and not his subject. I'd be more infuriated if he was *not* up front about this. 




I'm not going to say that people can't be easily misled, because they certainly can. But what is the alternative? 100% accuracy in all things? In many historical cases we can't even form a working consensus on what happened, or for what reason - that doesn't eliminate the ancient drive to tell stories about our history. If filmmakers want to be as accurate as possible they can - the Band of Brothers series comes to mind. But if they would prefer not to, and are happy to tell us that they are not even trying, what's the problem?",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced argument about the complexities of historical accuracy in films.

"&gt;To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. 

That ship has sailed. You're likely male, and as such, have viewed nude images of women online. You probably have seen many nude images. You're not giving your SO something unique, you've looked at numerous women and will likely compare your SO to such women. When this is the thousandth body you've explored then the specialness somewhat wears off.

Extra specialness, which you generally can't get online, comes from your emotional connection, attraction, and desire for each other. 

She, biologically, likely has a body similar to many of the women you've seen online and many men have likely imagined having sex with her and imagined her body, with moderate accuracy, regardless of her clothing. 

A good relationship comes from emotional connections which are often aided by your partner being hot and smelling nice and tasting good and having a pretty voice. When you accept each other and all your flaws, when you have ways to avoid fights, when you know how to touch each other properly, stuff like that. Bar your girlfriend secretly being some kind of alien human hybrid, you've seen a lot of women like her naked, she's probably seen a lot of men like you naked, your physical attire is going to have little impact on your relationship.","I'm from the US. The big stereotype of Americans is that we are very prideful. This is accurate for a large portion of the population.

Now, my personal view on this doesn't really apply as my wife and I have an open relationship. Most couples, however, have this view of showing off their girlfriend or wife. ""This hot girl right here? She's mine. Look at what I have that you can't. This makes me better than you."" (This is a little bit exaggerated to make my point, but is essentially accurate.)

"First, to quibble:

&gt;We need 100 Bernies.

60 Bernies would be sufficient to be filibuster-proof.

Now, for serious discussion.  Saying he ""cant follow up on any"" is a bit of an overstatement.  Can he do everything he'd like to do the way he'd like to?  No.  But can he make moves in the right direction?  Sure.

Let's look at his Agenda:

*  1. Rebuilding Our Crumbling Infrastructure

Now, this is something that he'd absolutely need Congressional help with.  But it's not hard to sell as pro-business and pro-jobs.  Americans like highways.

* 2. Reversing Climate Change

There is a lot he can do with EPA regulations.  And, again, he sells it as ""Transforming our energy system will not only protect the environment, it will create good paying jobs.""

* 3. Creating Worker Co-ops

Frankly, I'm not sure what, legally would be required for this - whether the department of labor alone can get this done, or he'd need help from Congress.

* 4. Growing the Trade Union Movement

Again, this is somewhat of a mixed bag, but probably more Congress than DoL.  It's also something that I think has some limitations at the Federal level, since a lot of it is governed at the state.

* 5. Raising the Minimum Wage

Definitely needs Congress.

* 6. Pay Equity for Women Workers

I believe that there are already laws on the books that he could choose to enforce more vigorously.  But I'm also not sure what he thinks the goverment should do about this.

* 7. Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers

Now, this is something that the president can absolutely have a huge impact on.

* 8. Making College Affordable for All

Obama has made some strides here.  I don't know how much more he can do without Congress.

* 9. Taking on Wall Street

Again, there's a lot more stringent enforcement of laws, investigations into trading, etc that the executive branch can do, but they certainly can't ""break up the banks"" without Congress.

* 10. Health Care as a Right for All

Yeah, single-payer for everyone can't happen without Congress.

* 11. Protecting the Most Vulnerable Americans

Another one where he can't expand social programs without Congress.

* 12. Real Tax Reform
Again, Congress needs to amend tax law.  Even enforcing through the IRS is restricted by Congressional law.

"Sex is biological. Gender is how ones biology and actions interact with society. Gender exists, just as much as democracy and popularity. Each society over history has handled gender in different ways, and it changes over time. In the west for the past decade or so the view of gender had become increasingly compkex. As you pointed out intersex is a real thing, it is physically obvious sonething is in a gray zone there. Mental differences between sexes are just as biologically real, and the right conbo of hormones and developmeny history can lead to mixing of self perceived gender as well. 

For most of history such people had to hide from persecution, but now in many places we can have real dialog. About it. This is hopefully leading to a society where people can live without fear or oppression regardless of their perceived or believed gender. Such change is still in transition, so there is still a lot of push to keep things going. As with all movements, sonetimes the push is unpleasant, and yet often the pain is due to losing the comfoetable status quo.","&gt; I'm not a very spiritual person. And I don't believe in a lot 'outside' of what we can percieve. Yes I believe there's more to the world, but I don't believe in anything beyond biological sex. Of course it's not binary. Intersex people very obviously exist, that's just scientific fact.

I'm having trouble understanding what exactly your view is, as I'm sure you'll understand seeing as you acknowledged that it's rather vague and complicated. But your use of the word 'spiritual' is intriguing and I think that might be where the 'problem' (if I can use that word) with your view is.

Your use of 'spiritual' seems to imply that you see gender (as opposed to biological sex, although I disagree with that distinction for other reasons) as a *metaphysical* concept. This isn't the case, at least in most academic circles: it's a *social* concept. 

You seem to have empiricist leanings, but I feel like you've taken that a step beyond what is reasonable: although there is something inherently anti-empirical about metaphysical or spiritual claims, and so an empiricist would be sceptical of them, you've extended this scepticism to all non-physical claims, which isn't reasonable since there's clearly plenty of social and mental phenomena which are empirical but not physical. Take art, for instance. It's pretty clear that there is no essential physical property to what we call 'art', but that doesn't mean we can't study art and make objective statements about art beyond its physical attributes (we can talk about the role of art in society, or the history of art, or what art is influential etc.)

Art, then, is clearly an abstract concept in that it's not a physical concept. This doesn't make it 'not real', though. Do you see how there's a parallel with gender there? Or have I missed your view/this doesn't actually touch on what I assumed you were assuming?

",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a detailed and thoughtful explanation of the distinction between biological sex and gender, addressing the OP's concerns about the metaphysical nature of gender. It also uses examples and analogies to help clarify the concept of gender as a social construct, which may help the OP understand the topic better.",0
"&gt; First, there's a fairness question, since the taxes you pay should be the same no matter who you are. In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own.

That's not progressive, though.  That's just linear.  Progressive would mean the amount of tax owed increases proportionately faster than the value of the property.  ""Fairness"" is a hard concept to nail down - you probably wouldn't consider a linear income tax to be fair.

&gt; Second is an efficiency issue. Giving people tax abatements encourages them not to move (as in prop 13) or to not sell when they don't have good use for the property, such as this woman who is being sued for failing to maintain a property she can't afford to renovate, but keeps paying the very low taxes on.

I think the obvious competing interest here is that you don't want to, effectively, kick people out of their long-term homes because it so happens that the housing area around them became more expensive.  What do you say to this?","&gt; In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own.

That's not ""progressive."" Progressive means charging richer people more and poorer people less than they would pay given a linear scale.

A fictional example of progressive taxes: $100k property might have no tax, $200k property might have 10% tax, and  $300k property might have 40% tax.

That's progressive: you give up a more-than-linear chunk as you go up the scale.

"What you're describing is genetic programming.

Perhaps we will achieve sentience sooner than digitized humans. Doing it through genetic programming has a few issues, however.

Consider consciousness. Have you figured it out? Yes? Good, I'm glad we had this discussion, turn in plans for your Nobel Prize and let the Singularity begin.

No? That's disappointing. Oh well. Consciousness is very complex. How do you test if something has met the parameters for intelligence? Solving intelligent tests? At one point, that test was Chess. We did it, we made computers that were very good at making Chess moves, but they had no idea what Chess was, what it symbolized, what the significance of Chess was, they only knew some numbers tied to some positions. They likely didn't even know what winning or losing meant.

Next, there was the Turing test. Eugene Goostman beat the Turing test, but was still not considered to have our level of consciousness, if any at all. This is because the Turing test is very, very good at determining if you're SIMULATING consciousness. But not if you're actually conscious. Imagine it like school tests. What are they really measuring? How good are you at math or how good are you at getting the answers to the test? You'd think they're the same, but does getting a high math score prove that you know what math is? Why it's significant? Why it's beautiful? Why these equations are important in everyday life? No. A high math score just means you know how to solve the problems on the test.

Then there's the self awareness test, the Tokyo test, etc. We have a history of not having the BEST way to determine consciousness. We're not sure what it is. Maybe consciousness is a spectrum or continuum and we've already solved consciousness, but the AI we're making isn't conscious ENOUGH.

But back to genetic programming, eliminating what doesn't work and letting the best survive. The problem with genetic programming is, let's say you do find a way to test consciousness. It's probably going to involve a LOT of factors, right? Ability to have opinions, ability to change itself, ability to feel, ability to use natural language, ability to create, debate, CMV, etc. Consider the pragmatics.

How long it takes for each AI to see if they pass they test or to even realize they're testing. If you just force them, for all you know, you could just be making an AI that's programmed specifically to do each thing individually without filling in the gaps of consciousness in between. No, you need AIs that do a bunch of those things individually. How long do you leave it alone to see if it does anything before you eliminate the AI? Or do you take up an ungodly amount of resources to keep a bunch of complex computers the size of warehouses around, possibly taking up miles?

And you're doing this with each iteration. It could take forever.

Then, consider the ethics. Killing an AI because it's not ""good enough?"" Sound familiar to anyone? Are we allowed to do that because they're subhuman or something? That's another consideration. Is it okay to have an AI thrown into a test it knows nothing about only to kill it before it has a chance to have a quality life? In all likelihood, because of the randomness of their iterations, most of the AIs will be insane if they do become sentient and they'll suffer. They'll suffer real bad.

So, genetic programming, in my non-expert opinion, is not a good approach to conscious AI. Feel free to CMV.","What is happening inside neural networks isn't that different from what is happening inside your brain. Connections are constantly made and destroyed based on input, trying to optimize how certain task is performed. Optimizing a neural network is more similar to ""learning"" rather than ""evolving a brain"". How intelligent a neural network can become is limited by its design. If I build a neural network, it will never become intelligent, even if I let it run for years. Just like you can train a raccoon for years but it will never become smarter than a raccoon. You will never get a point where sentient AI will ""emerge spontaneously"". We will have to create it ourselves. Our systems will become better and smarter with each design iteration, until one day they are good enough to be indistinguishable from what we call ""intelligence"".

At the end of the day simulating a brain requires little understanding of how it works, but needs A LOT of computational power. Even simulating realistically a couple of neurons takes supercomputers. Building something intelligent from the ground up will be more efficient, but then you need to know precisely how to create such a system (i.e. deep understanding of intelligence and sentience).

The question which will happen first depends on how fast each field is advancing. If it turns out we are better at making faster computers and intelligence is extremely complex, then simulation will be first. If we turn out to be good at understanding how brains work, we might create AI before the tech simulating brains is available. Saying one will happen for certain is premature. After all, computers double in computational speeds every 18 months. Our understanding of brains and intelligence grows slower than that.

"It seems you're more concerned with the circumstances than the genders: rough overpowering rape &gt; drunk rape. But of course, (some) women can also overpower (some) men, especially when weapons are involved, and drunk women get taken advantage of all the time (unfortunately). 

Honestly, while I'd rather not make a value judgment either way, the things you said seem to make it worse for men rather than for women. Society expects men to be strong. If a man loses a fight to another man, he's a loser. If he loses to a women (and is dominated to the degree that she rapes him) he is the biggest loser to ever walk the planet. Furthermore, it probably wasn't ""real rape"" because if he got an erection then clearly he wanted it, and like all men he's just a ""horny fuck who is out there just to fuck women"".

"I get where you're coming from. I used to think similarly to you, but after I befriended some trans people, and other people in my life became comfortable enough to come out, I learned more. 

While some hyper-feminine trans women and hyper-masculine trans  men are genuinely just someone who naturally acts like the gender stereotype, a good amount of people who are trans feel a need to overcompensate. I also know some trans people who don't feel the need to preform gender roles, but feel pushed to do so too by people around them or society in general. For example I know a trans woman, but she still doesn't feel like dresses or skirts are really her thing, nor does it bother her to have a bit of stubble, or hairy legs. She'll get comments along the line of 'she's not really trans,' or 'if she actually wanted to be a woman, she'd do x and y'.

So non-gender-conforming trans people exist, but they're not really in the spot light.

We're judged by somebody either way, and I think most of us would rather lean toward the direction of gender expression that allowed us to be more often read as our true gender because we've been misgendered all our lives.

Edit: I want to add another point. Why don't cis women get this sort of backlash? Cis women are all over magazines in all sorts of over-the-top feminine outfits and expressions. Why is one trans woman who looks nice and is all done up on the cover of *vanity fair* the enemy of feminists?

"&gt;  but given how fast cars depreciate in value

Because this isn't universally true.   Plenty of cars depreciate slowly too.

Luxury european models?  Depreciate 50% in 2 years.

But take a truck?

Bought my F150 new for $40k, 4 years ago.  KBB today is $38k.  No Brainer.

Bought my Corvette new for $60k 2 years ago, KBB still around 55k.","Depends on the country, also.  Where I live, the cheapest chinese models cost about 8-10 grand, korean, american and japanese subcompact city cars go for about 10-14 grand, and more compact cars go for 14-18k.  Now, if a new car costs you 14k, like a small toyota, after 5 years and 50,000 m, that car costs about 10-12k, or about 60-75% of it's value.  Toyotas in particular don't depreciate much because of their good reputation, but that's still a lot of money for something that isn't ""new"" anymore, and may have underlying problems and will face maintenance sooner.  This trend is the same across the board with a few exceptions: chinese cars, since the rate of lemons is kind of high, tend to have a much lower resale value.  You basically buy a chinese car for keeps.

it also depends on the situation,  my wife and I are specifically looking for a new car, since her car is 5 years old, we figure it'd be a good idea to alternate buying a new car every 5 years, and buying a seminew car always raises questions.  Why was that car bought in 2014 sold in 2015, when the ink was still dry on the auto loan?  Is it really worth risking 10k to save 2-4k on a car?  Again, this is probably a bigger concern depending on the culture and affluence.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides specific examples of cars that depreciate slowly, such as trucks and luxury European models.

The patients. But that's not possible in a world where popularity trumps knowledge. 

When people adopt counter- and non-scientific opinions, massaged into fact-shaped blurbs by TV charlatans, they replace reason with rationalization. They become trained to accept utterly arbitrary data based on how well it soothes their mind and conforms to their biases rather than the outcome of clinical trials. And when the real scientific process, ugly, slow, and unintuitive, rears its head, they become hostile towards it. 

Charlatans crave ignorance, and when their audiences accept their roles as empty-headed children, unworthy of and uninterested in knowledge of the real world, our society becomes ever more dangerous. 

Basic ethical concepts in medicine like [""informed consent""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent) become impossible. We make medical decisions totally ignorant of the process and disconnected from the principles. Media panics and trends steal our attention and squander our limited ability to care for our personal health. Blinded by lies and deprived of tools, we rely on luck and chance.

","You're comparing these fear mongers to fictional movies, but there's a key difference.  Independence Day doesn't claim to be telling a true story.  These fear mongers on the other hand are presenting themselves as experts.  See the difference?  It's the same reason a sci-fi movie about aliens visiting ancient Egypt would be goofy entertainment, but the History Channel's Ancient Aliens is a disgraceful, misleading, embarrassing series.  It claims to be discussing a possibly legitimate truth; therefore it transitions from mere entertainment to actively misleading the public for profit. 

Everyone is happy about their beliefs.  Racists, Nazis, ISIS, you name it.  Feeling good about your beliefs doesn't mean your propaganda should be ""applauded.""  Attitudes have an impact on society.

It doesn't matter if it makes people happy to be told outright lies for profit, that's not the point.  The point is that it's morally wrong to spread lies that put people in danger, especially children.

If a parent truly wants to feel better, they should listen to people who actually spend their lives trying to develop real, testable, concrete cures to disease.

"There are a few things which are concerning with orbital debris.

First though, a little primer on orbital mechanics.

Your velocity and your orbit are the same thing.  If you give me the velocity (that is speed+direction) and location of a spacecraft at a single point, I can tell you its orbital path.^1

Second, there are certain orbital ""sweet spots"" which are beneficial for various reasons.  One of the most beneficial (and most crowded) is geostationary orbit.  Geostationary orbit is where your orbit matches Earth's rotation such that the satellite appears to always be at the same place in the sky.  It's great for communication satellites.

Geostationary orbit is a single circular ring around Earth.  It's at the equator, about 36000 km from Earth's surface.  It's not a plane, or a 3-dimensional space, it's a single line.

Ok, so why is this a concern:

First, things in orbit move very, very fast.  When I said that velocity tells me your orbit, I didn't give an idea of how fast these velocities are.  The Space Station for instance is travelling at about 27,600 kph relative to Earth's surface.  That's crazy fast.  If you were listening to the song [about walking 1000 miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ4Ib-7fJqY) on the ISS, you would have traveled a thousand miles by the end.^2

At those speeds, an impact is absolutely devastating.  We're talking multiple times faster than speeding bullets.  

Also, orbits need constant maintenance.  Due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon, anything in orbit is constantly being tugged around and pushed to different orbital paths.  This means that debris which can no longer be controlled will not just stay put, but possibly come intersect with orbits we want to use.

Satellites in active use are tweaking their orbits constantly to keep where they need to be.  When they get to the end of their useful life, they're generally either sent to burn up in Earth's atmosphere, or to a very high orbit to be out of the way.

The nightmare scenario is a single impact between two larger objects causing a lot of uncontrolled debris though.  It would be too small to see where it is, or predict where it will go, but yes, a bolt or a scrap of solar panel can completely wreck a large spacecraft.  



-----

^1 I'll probably use a computer though because I'm lazy.  

^2 [Source](https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/)","I think the issue is that 1) Satellites orbit at a specific altitude, and 2) space debris covers a much larger area/volume than you'd expect, seeing as tiny particles whizzing around at incredible speeds can do a lot of damage to delicate instruments.

Check out [this](http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2012/oct/04/astronomy-space) article for more information. It uses the ISS as an example; the ISS has had to make maneuvers to dodge space debris. When objects in space are hit by debris, they themselves shatter into debris, causing a chain reaction.

"My answer will be from the perspective of a university student in the UK, so it might not apply directly to the US.

Low numbers of right-leaning students and faculty at universities is but a symptom of a far larger problem; Politicism or political discrimination. This is a problem that won't be solved by affirmative action because there are other disincentives for right-leaning people to express their views anywhere.

**Part 1: Politicism outside university**

Our recent general election, and the surprise Conservative victory, lead to an outpouring of hatred and discrimination directed at the Prime Minister, MPs and voters who 'voted wrong'. Not even one day had passed before it descended into violence in the streets of the capital.

There is a certain level of ""anti-right"" culture emerging in the West whereby the left believes that, because the right are so vile and evil, any level of silencing or hatred directed at the right is justified. Needless to say, the only place I really speak my mind on the subject of politics is anonymously online or with close family. A lot of other people have the same attitude. While I was initially hesitant to call this ""censorship"", based upon the left-wing concept of ""No Platform"" I do now genuinely believe this is censorship, in many cases deliberately done.

**Part 2: The Student Union**

In the UK, students are theortetically represented by the Student Union. At the national level, it is called the NUS (although not all student unions are affiliated with the NUS). This organization is so left-wing that even Maoists would call them loons. 

The NUS, not Universities themselves, [is the primary source of on-campus censorship in the UK.](http://www.spiked-online.com/free-speech-university-rankings/analysis#.VYd03PlVhBc) Pro-life groups are banned at 4 universities. Right-leaning newspaper ""The Sun"" is banned at 26 theoretically for having nude models on Page 3, yet effectively identical content is still available in other publications making the actual motive of censoring right-wing content completely transparent. 

The NUS even supports Boycott, Diverstment and Sanctions for Israel. The level of intimidation this can cause for Israeli students attending university in the UK is obvious.

At the NUS Women's conference 2015, proposals were put forward to replace clapping with jazz hands because of concerns that clapping would cause anxiety attacks. Additionally, gay men were accused of appropriating black female culture and a proposal was put forward to ban crossdressing.

Bahar Mustafa, a ""Welfare and Diversity officer"" that works for a student union, has even gotten away with [banning white people from an anti-racism event.](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/white-people-have-now-been-banned-from-an-anti-racism-event-at-a-british-university/)

The NUS uses it's power to censor it's political opponents, to intimidate right-leaning students and enforce it's narrative upon new students. It completely fails to represent students, yet at the national level there is no competitor to the NUS.

**Part 3: Lecturers and other university incidents**

[Read this blog post in its entirety.](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/05/if-youre-a-conservative-im-not-your-friend/)

If you were a conservative voter studying philosophy at Royal Holloway, there is massive incentive for you to hide your views because of the hateful political attitudes of one of the faculty. No doubt similar hateful attitudes are held silently by even more faculty. This isn't even a personal blog; it's an academic one.

It's so bad that I hide my political beliefs at my own university, and I would describe myself as a Centrist, not right-leaning.

There have been multiple incidents at British universities where Israeli students or speakers have faced intimidation. [Here's just one of them.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford)

**Part 4: Why affirmative action is insufficient**

Affirmative action is supposed to be a last resort effort to increase inclusion after anti-discrimination measures have been tried. Unfortunately, there has been zero attempt to prevent political discrimination at university. If anything, it seems actively encouraged. Until that encouragement is ended and regular support avenues for non-left students are set up affirmative action will do nothing.

My personal recommendations for the UK:

* At a national level, set up a competitor to the NUS. There are a handful of student unions that have chosen to separate from the NUS due to it's radicalism that could work together to form this. It would be politically neutral.

* Prevent the NUS from enforcing censorship policies.

* Fire faculty and reprimand students who partake in or encourage discrimination towards anyone who is right-leaning.

* Crackdown on the currently legitimized and even supported Anti-Semetic and Anti-Israeli policies enacted at universities.

* Create a system by which students can report politicism, preferably at a level above universities instead of at the university itself because of the likelihood that such a system would be co-opted to deny right-leaning students access to it.

* Ensure that progenitors of Conservative ideology, such as Edmund Burke, are studied alongside the progenitors of Socialist ideology where relevant even prior to University level.

* Remove communist agitprop (such as ""An Inspector Calls"") from the English Literature GCSE.

If, after enacting all these policies and waiting 20 years, there is still a severe leftist slant in UK academia, then Affirmative Action would be worth considering as a last resort.","It's not just the Social Sciences that are dominated by the Left. The majority of *all* sciences skew towards the left rather than the right. 

I mean, the decision to be an academic has many qualities that appeal more to a Liberal than a Conservative.

1. For example, why would a highly educated and talented scientist rather work as a researcher post-doc with dismal pay, rather than find a high-paying industry job? Because he is less motivated by the size of the salary but more-so by the perceived value of the work he does. Certain kinds of people would rather do poorly paid University Research. Republicans are obsessed with minimizing taxes to maximize your personal income. Is it surprising that Republicans elect to take a higher paying industry job rather than stay in lower-paying academia? 


2. Moreover, graduate schools are dominated by foreign-born students coming to America as a pathway to citizenship. At my state university, the vast majority of grad-students were foreigners, and the faculty was too. Is it particularly surprising that a multicultural faculty is hostile towards US White Conservatism? Perhaps then the very reason why Academia is Left-dominated is precisely because of *diversity*. Of course professors will be angry at pro-white, anti-multiculturalist rants, when their demographics are much more multicultural than the larger US population!

As far as you know, most faculties may already have ideologically-based affirmative action programs in place. American universities are obviously not structurally homogeneous. Unfortunately, the talent pool of willing applicants may be so small that finding a qualified Conservative is nearly impossible. Just look at the stereotype of a Liberal arts graduate student! Do you really suppose a mainstream Conservative man will spend 5 years of his life on a PhD history thesis without salary? Will the typical Conservative stereotype elect to study the social sciences?


Finally, let's not forget the irony that affirmative-action-for-Republicans would fly against the face of Republican politics and ideology. Universities hire academics that can produce lots and lots of viable papers. Publish or perish. Moreover, Universities such as Harvard are private institutions that ""ought to"" do whatever the fuck they want. According to Republican political positions, ideologically-based affirmative action ought not be allowed. Positions should be given solely on merit - or in the Academic's case - their ability to generate vast amounts of research papers and bring prestige to the University. Conservatives should not be allowed into academia for the exact reason why Blacks or Latinos or other affirmative action'ed classes should not be allowed in - because they simply could not compete and do not have the necessary merit to be chosen.

Conservative professors should not be coddled by affirmative action, or they shall grow lazy and incompetent! ",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the issue of political discrimination in academia, both inside and outside of universities.

"According to Google, the average steer weight is 550 kilos (1200 lbs) and the average yield is 220 kilos (490 lbs). Furthermore, calves are slaughtered for veal at 18-20 weeks of age, when their weight is about 200 to 230 kilos (450 to 500 lbs). If we take the ratio of body weight to yield weight to be the same, that's about 90 kilos (195 lbs).

&gt; there is not such a great difference between the experience of a baby cow and an adult cow that one will experience death any differently than the other

&gt; I do think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing

You stated that their deaths are essentially the same, and that you find the suffering of animals unethical. Using the numbers above, around 2.5 calves must be slaughtered to provide the same amount of meat as a single fully grown cow. Therefore, to provide the same amount of meat, it is about two and a half times as unethical to slaughter calves, on the basis of their deaths.

&gt; Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. 

I'm sure anyone could argue about this with you but its not the point of the CMV so ill leave it.","Since the lives of cattle are unpleasant, on the surface it seems that slaughtering them at an earlier age would minimize suffering and would therefore be less immoral.

The reality of veal however, is that it is essentially a by-product of the dairy industry.  To keep cows lactating they must constantly be producing calves.  Excess male calves are often used for veal rather than raised as steers, or (very rarely) breeding bulls simply because it takes less time and space away from their more profitable mothers.  A dairy cow generally lives about 5 years until it's milk production wanes, while steers raised for meat are only forced to live 18 months or so, and obviously veal calves get to die very quickly.

So while killing baby cows may alleviate more suffering than killing adult cows for food, in practice it is inextricably linked to keeping adult cows alive for food, causing them to suffer far more than they would had they been raised for meat rather than milk.  Add to the fact that many of these calves wouldn't have to be born or suffer at all if not for their essential role in keeping dairy cows lactating.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a more detailed and nuanced argument about the ethical implications of slaughtering calves for veal, highlighting the interconnectedness of the dairy and veal industries. It also addresses the suffering of adult cows in the dairy industry, making a stronger case for why veal production is unethical.",0
"The problem is there are thousands of vaccines in the world, all with their own specific goal, their own specific ingredients and therefor their own specific interaction with the human body. Saying vaccinating is a bad idea because some may or may not cause negative side effects is akin to saying that eating is a bad idea because some people have bad reactions to certain foods. It is nonsensical.

Yes, there are undoubtebly some horror stories out there about cases where vaccination may or may not have played a role. And that is absolutely sad and horrible for the parents involved. But the inevitable result of introducing a foreign object (the vaccine) into the human body is that somebody, somewhere is going to have an adverse reaction to this. In the end, life itself is inherently risky and we can never eliminate all risks. I myself am terribly allergic to walnuts. Give me a handful and I'll be dead before you can call an ambulance. In the US alone it is estimated there are over 15 million people with food allergies (1 in 20), yet how many parents will have their children tested before giving them their first peanut butter? I would guess none. Why? Because the risk is thought to be minimal. Yes, there might be countless horror stories, and some of these might even be true, but billions of people have been vaccinated over the years. Compared to that number, even if all these stories are true, means that there is virtually no risk whatsoever. A child is far more likely to die from eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich than from getting complications from vaccinations.

Now a lot has already been said about the actual health dangers to vaccinations, I could add to it, but instead I'll direct you to a very informative video by Potholer54:

[Health, vaccinations and junk science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ZZTjChW4o)

(Potholer54 is a journalist who regularly makes videos debunking junk science, I suggest you check out his channel).
","&gt;  Between whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.


The problem with this argument is that it is open ended and not grounded in a fact or idea.  It is as hard to dispute it as it is to dispute the comment *""I am scared""*.  

Whistle-blowers are essential to keep groups honest.  It doesn't mean that the whole system is better off gone.  It only means that there are more flaws than an entity would otherwise acknowledge.  I'm not familiar with everyone on the list, but considering that Obama immediately granted William Thompson immunity from any crimes for testifying clearly indicates that we're not looking at a conspiracy. He spoke out and he was encouraged to do so.

&gt;  Now I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.


As /u/amazingmrbrock pointed out in what might be deemed *the laziest CMV comment in history* there's more at stake than what you can plainly see.  Specifically Herd Immunity.  That means that we are communally protected from diseases because they are less prevalent.  So for instance, babies younger than 1 year old or the elderly with weakened immune systems may not be able to be vaccinated.  However the lack of prevalence of the disease in society makes it that they are still safe.  So being vaccinated is not just about saving your life but it is about saving the lives of others around you.


Separately, it is important not to look at public policy from an empirical perspective.  Everyone will always know of a story about someone who suffered in some way.  This only points out that a system is not perfect, which was never really in contention. The only question is if the system is better than the lack of a system.  Which *statistics* do a much better job at proving.  Looking at the [Anti-vaccine Body count](http://www.antivaccinebodycount.com/Anti-Vaccine_Body_Count/Home.html) we can see staggering numbers in preventable diseases and deaths.  

If vaccines caused autism or had similar effects, then surely it would be measurable in a similar way.  We could reconcile that data against each other.

"&gt; If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental and physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

First of all, it's a false equivalency to say that people have a choice between either A) prostitution or B) starvation.   In most western countries, prositition is practically never the *only* option women with limited marketably skills/education have to make money, it just happens to be the most lucrative.  Waiting tables, cashiering, working retail, coupled with a relatively strong social safety net (like foodstamps, medicaid, rental credit/section 8 housing), is how the vast majority of the working poor survive.

It isn't just psychological and physical damage, there's some serious damage to both the immediate incentives and long term prosperity of people, particularly women, that go into prostitution, which are quite destructive.  Lets ignore the psychological damage/addiction cycles synonimous with prostitution and focus instead simple career growth, total earning potential, and the cycle of poverty.  A prostitute's peak earning potential is when they are the youngest and freshest (probably), and gradually dimishes from there.  Lets say a 20 year old can make 200-300 a night, 5 nights a week, that works out to about 50k-70k per year.  Very good income for someone of that age, certainly tough to walk away from considering the expected income of 20-30k, but nothing you can retire off of, and that's their peak income, and it will only go down from there. After 10 years, they're 30, maybe they're still pretty hot, but they can only get 150 a night.  so that means that after 10 years experience, the 45K.  5 years later, they're probably starting to show their age, lets say it drops down to 150.  39k.  Once they hit 40 they're most likely on their way down, if they stay in tip top shape, they could probably still get 100 a night. (even that's kind of generous).  

At what point does the person decide that the money isn't worth it anymore?  Is that point before or after when they feel like they're young enough where they can start their career in something else?  Does someone who go into prostitution hope to work in the same industry until retirement age?  

While it's true that low wage work isn't great, it can lead to opportunities of advancement, promotions and pay raises.  There are virtually zero of these in prostitution.

On the flip side, legal prostitution means higher demand from consumers, leading more people to pay for it, and increasing hte number of people going into as a profession.   While the level of damage each individual would decrease, the number of total damage would increase.

The types of people that choose this type of work would be lower class people with little career perspectives that would make some money for a while, but over the long term, most would be screwing themselves over financially and careerwise in the long term.","Your argument assumes that a person may be faced with a choice between sex work and slow starvation. This isn't true in most first world nations. The social safety net does a pretty good job keeping mouths fed. 

There are exceptions to this of course, but most of them are solvable (husband drinks all the money away) or involve other illegal activity (drug addictions).

So, given that the social safety nets will keep people from starving, what's the difference between legal sex work and illegal sex work? If sex work is legalized, poor people will have to try sex work before welfare becomes available to them. **Poor people will be *expected* to try sex work before they are given relief.**  

""Can't get a normal job? Have you tried prostitution? No? Well, try that, and *then* the government will help you out.""

---

So, who cares? Well, you personally may not think that prostitution is immoral, but *billions* of other people do think that. Legalizing prostitution will mean saying to all those Catholic single mothers ""no, you can't have welfare support unless you're willing to sell your body."" Does that sound acceptable to you?",1,2,False,Response 2 provides a strong argument against legalizing prostitution by highlighting the potential societal implications of expecting poor individuals to turn to sex work before receiving welfare.

"It doesn't take an expert to spot the flaw in that sort of argument. It is an informal fallacy, called ""appeal to worse problems"". There are many reasons why it does not work, you have named several.

However, as with many fallacies, the idea behind it has merit. All problems are not equal. Devoting time, effort, money, etc. to lesser problems at the expense of larger ones is undesirable, all else being equal. What's important is whether one can provide good reasons why one issue should take precedence over another, and to what degree.","The reason people are complaining about the killing of the lion taking up so much airspace is this: there is a finite amount of time in a day, and therefore a finite amount of time that one can spend watching/reading/hearing about/talking about news. People are not really mad that we're talking about Cecil's killing in the wake of the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose. People are made that we're talking about Cecil's killing **at the expense of** talking about the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose.

Nobody's arguing that the lion's death isn't tragic. People are arguing that the lion's death is not so tragic that it's worth completely ignoring yet more examples of not only police brutality but straight-up lies told by the police to cover that brutality up. We want positive change, sure, but it's good to prioritize.

You say that ""people have the capacity to care about more than one issue."" This is true. However, people also only have a finite capacity to care about issues in general. When certain issues are shoved far enough out of the spotlight in favor of - quite frankly - more important ones, these issues stop being cared about enough to actually effect change.

Tl;dr: it's not that we shouldn't care about ""less important"" issues, it's that we have a finite amount of time and space and mental energy to care about issues in general. Therefore, we should apportion appropriately and not give undue attention to an issue which is not as important.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a clear and logical argument for why the focus on the killing of Cecil the lion is problematic in the context of more pressing issues like police brutality.

"My girlfriend and I are partially long distance since I'm away at college. Our primary method of communication is text, with phone calls at least weekly.

Texts allow you to deliver a portion of the conversation in a small digestible chunk. It forces you to think about what you're saying and make it somewhat concise and intelligible. It allows a back and forth in which both people can contribute equally (since one person can't vocally talk over the other), and you can take more time to understand what the person is saying in the break between each text. In fact, you can now have conversations stretched out over much longer periods of time because of the ability to pace your texts, which you don't get in a phone call. 

Furthermore, sometimes passions can easily get inflamed when talking on the phone or face to face (particularly when raising one's voice or making a passionate point). In some cases, texting abstracts that away, since it forces you to type it out (in others cases though, the texts can be misinterpreted and thus lead to arguments).

So I don't see why texting should be seen a a less valid way of having a full conversation. Sometimes my girlfriend and I prefer calling, other times texting.

"It's not bad because it's dangerous, it's bad because it is the deliberate infliction of direct harm on yourself, and that goes directly against *normal* biological impulse.

I'd say that because we have evolved to want to *avoid* harm: healthy functioning humans avoid harm; they even avoid the *risk* of harm where that risk is significant.

An individual who transgresses this instinct of avoiding harm is seen as unhealthy, and the act viewed as morally undesirable.

&gt; It is very easy to self harm without any danger. Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.

This may be true today, but for our entire evolutionary history this was absolutely false. Any and all wounds carried *significant* risk, so we have, as a species and in general, developed an instinctual response to avoid them.

If someone demonstrates that they *lack* that preventitive instinct by cutting themselves there's an immediate cause for moral concern because so much of our socially acceptable behaviour (ie: morality) is tied up in biological instincts: the rational desire to live, empathy, and so on.

Self-harming, even if it effects no one else, *does* call into question someone's mental state and fitness to act in a pro-social way, so I think it's fine for us to want to discourage that kind of behaviour and label it 'bad'.","&gt;The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace ""self harm"" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.

Cooking is bad because it is dangerous. You could get burned.

These points all do not quite fit the definition of harmful = bad. In all these situations, the activity is done where a risk of harm is present, but the practitioners try to avoid harm.


Self harm is more like an addiction, such as drug abuse or alcohol abuse. Where it is done as a coping mechanism to cover deeper rooted problems within a person, and can quickly become addictive to the point where a person cannot stop themselves from doing in.


Even then, the pain and damage caused by drugs is an unintended consequence. The comedown, the shakes, the liver damage, the collapsed veins and ruined skin.  No body takes methamphetamines because they want to damage their body with them

The principle they're using as a shield is not the idea that the law is always morally right. Very few adults believe that ""moral"" is identical with ""legal.""

"Your opening assertion is patently false.  Josephus and Tacitus both reference the death of Jesus and neither man's writing is included in the Bible, of course.  Your second assertion does not square even remotely with current scholarship on the gospels.  It's only mythicists who think we can trace all the gospels back to Mark.  At bare minimum you have Mark and Q.  Your remaining assertions are not terribly substantive.  

The bottom line is that we have multiple, largely independent sources referencing Jesus within a century of his death.  That is a reasonable body of evidence considering the status of the man (yet another Jewish troublemaker in a backwater of the Roman Empire) and the general lack of sources to survive from the period in general.

**Christian Sources.** You have the gospels (and the sources lying behind the gospels like Q).  You have Paul (Galatians 1 being the strongest link, in which he mentions meeting with Peter and James in the mid 30s).  Both Paul and the extant gospels preserve earlier material, e.g. the hymn in Philippians or Matthew 12:1-8, likely surviving elements of earlier oral traditions.

**Jewish Sources** Josephus in his Antiquities mentions Jesus twice, in books 18 and 20.  He also mentions John the Baptist in Book 18.  The references to John and the reference to Jesus in Book 20 are considered authentic by the overwhelming majority of Josephus scholars.  The reference to Jesus in Book 18, the Testimonium, is obviously an interpolation but there is widespread agreement among scholars that the passage contains an authentic core.  

**Roman Sources.** You have Tacitus, Suetonius and Pliny the Younger.  Of those three, Tacitus is the strongest and clearest reference.  

For the mythicist case to stand, you need to explain away all of those references.  You also need to explain why somebody in the first century would invent a supposed Jewish messiah who acts nothing like what every Jew knew the messiah was supposed to be (hint: it wasn't dying in shame on the cross).  You need to explain why Matthew and Luke take great pains to explain how a man from Nazareth was actually from Bethlehem, when if the man were a fiction they could simply have placed him in the right city to begin with.","I hope that this doesn't get burried, I've thought a bout this for quite some time trying to figure out the best way to approach this. Firstly I will attack your claims using logic and reasoning and methods that are used to determine history from primary sources. ignoring le STEM circlejerk logic, and facts do dictate what is considered history, while there is room for debate most people will come to similar conclusions via exegesis. 

I will begin with your own admission

&gt;maybe there was an itinerant sage named Yeshua who ran around, gathered a minor following, and was executed for sedition. 

as you are already on the edge of accepting these things as facts, and you should for good reason. everything we know from history we don't actually know, we have epistemological trust that they are true. That is we have to judge who to believe, and what to believe. For example if Rush Limbaugh says ""all comunists are bad people"" we know that we should not necessarilly believe that all comunists are bad because Rush Limbaugh is biased. We can understand that Rush, along with a fair few other people believe that communists are bad people, and that there may even be a few bad communists, but it wouldn't make since for us to believe that *ALL* communists are bad. 

you have chosen to believe that Tacitus is not worth your epistomological trust, thats fine i suppose, we still have pliny the younger, seutonius, and Josephus, but let us assume that they were all liars, or wrong or missunderstood, or whatever. the question then becomes ""who will you believe existed?"" perhaps you would accept James, the brother of Jesus, or Paul the  apostle, or peter, the first pope, or the second pope, or the third pope, etc. find a person you belive exists in relation to jesus and ask yourself, ""does it make sense that the third pope would know the second pope?, the second pope the first, (i.e. Peter), and would Peter have moved away from his homeland, changed religions and died for a person who did not exist? if so what is his motive? Ockhams law would dictate from this alone that Jesus, or Yeshua, did exist. 

thats great news! this means that we suddenly have a whole lot of primary documents to look at, pliny is back, josephus is back, tacitus is back, the gospels are back, Q is back, the gnostic gospels are all back and useful. sure they may be propaganda, but propaganda can be incredibly useful, it may not give you the day someone was born, but it sure as heck can give you an idea about their ideology. 

One thing that everyone of the primary sources agrees on is that jesus was crucified, and the plaque on his cross read ""KING OF THE JEWS"". crucifiction, as agreed by every historian i've ever heard/read was reserved by the romans for people who were trying to rebel against the empire. this would imply that Jesus, Yeshua, was a rebel, a pretender to the thrown of Jerusalem. this is just one piece of evidence that points to this, there is also the meaning of the word ""messiah"", the messianic secret, the other self proclaimed messiahs, the talk of the coming of the kingdom of god, all of it points to a proto-zealot like figure who was trying to upend the roman government. 

using almost entirely a priori arguments I believe I have proven that the most likely case is that.

&gt;there was an itinerant sage named Yeshua who ran around, gathered a minor following, and was executed for sedition.

this alone shatters the jesus myth hypothesis as anything except convoluted and unlikely, furthermore by looking at the texts we can draw several other conclusions, he was most likely a day laborer in tiberias until his thirties, he was most likely born in nazareth, his father may not have been known as he was refered to as yeshua bar mary which would have been an insult, he was most likely john the baptists disciple, etc. 

in conclusion the most likely case is that jesus did exist, every other hypothesis has much less evidence, and is much more convoluted following ockhams razor a historical jesus is the most likely true case. furthermore using the primary documents, even if they are bald faced lies, we can draw conclusions about the life and times of jesus.

Donald Kaufman: That was her business, not mine. You are what you love, not what loves you. That's what I decided a long time ago.

Ultimately, I get to choose the object of my desire. Even if that person despises me, I can still choose to love them.

","In this same regard though, wouldn't it be the same as someone thinking about punching someone in the face as assault? Or thinking about harming someone, or murdering them be considered attempted man slaughter? 

What about a sexual dream involving someone you know, that didn't consent to the dream your subconscious had about them? Would that be considered rape?

Also, how are you going to monitor what people think at any given time? It honestly sounds like a movie where people are so controlled that they can't even have a thought without being punished. 

You are essentially asking people to get permission to think. Thousands of thoughts go through peoples heads unchecked every day and no one is the wiser. I glanced at a woman this morning and noticed her boobs, they looked very nice, I thought about them for a while. Should I have told her? No, because there isn't a point, it would have just made her uncomfortable and then it can be constituted as harassment.

"Well when it comes to gender dysphoria, gender is used to mean something more like ""how i perceive myself/how i think i should be"", rather than like ""masculinity and femininity"", which is how its usually used. These are sometimes split up into ""gender identity"" and ""gender roles"". (Most of the time,) when someone wants to transition, it's not about wanting to fit in with the more masculine/feminine gender role, its about being uncomfortable with their biological sex, and wanting to fix that. Transsexual has obvious connotations with sexual orientations like homosexual though, and people use the term transgender to avoid that.

Theres some evidence that gender identity is rooted in the brain, and assuming that's true, it exists in a fairly definable way. Gender roles and masculinity/femininity exist more as a concept, and can vary greatly between cultures. In that way ""gender"" doesn't really exist in any absolute, definable way.","Oddly enough, gender is just as biological as sex. There are marked, important (and known!) differences between the brains of women and those of men. Gender dysphoria is often visible in an fMRI as those with it will have the same brain structure of their chosen gender but the sex organs of the other gender.

"Maybe you aren't at shops/restaurants/etc at the same time that a majority of handicapped people are. My friend (who uses a wheelchair) intentionally goes shopping during less busy hours of the day because it's easier for her to move through the aisles if there are fewer people around. Just because you don't see handicapped people using the spots doesn't mean they're not used when you aren't at the store. 

The amount of time you spend within eyeshot of a handicapped spot is very low. I'll be generous and say it takes you ten minutes, on average, per outing to walk to or from your car and the store. Even neglecting the fact that you're likely not paying close attention to the status of the handicapped spots 100% of the time that you're in the lot, that's still only a tiny fraction of the time that the business is open for the day. Your perception that they're ""always empty"" is the result of confirmation bias, which makes it seem like the spots are constantly empty when in fact you only know for sure (from your observations) that they're empty for the ten to twenty or so minutes that you're in the car park each day, and only on such occasions when you happen to observe and make note of the fact that they're empty. 

Edit: Spelling. ","I must have heard soooo many stories from people who catch flak because they don't ""look disabled"" just because they can walk the short distance from the handicapped spot to the store.

"Let's take the first part of the California Indecent exposure law:

public place, or in any place where there are present other persons
to be offended or annoyed thereby; or,

Pay careful attention to the first sentence, because it's the most important. Breastfeeding is not typically done ""lewdly"". Basically every indecent exposure law has this kind of requirement.

A woman that ""breastfed"" in the manner of a striptease in public might well be violating indecent exposure laws. Doing so normally is not, because it's not lewd. ","What is indecent about it?

You say you're basing your view on the law, but [""Twenty-nine states exempt breastfeeding from public indecency laws.""](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx) So in over 50% of the US, breast feeding is *not* considered ""indecent exposure."" 

Does your CMV only apply to the 21 states that don't have the exemption? Even in those states: ""Forty-nine states have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location."" So really if you're saying ""I don't believe this is indecent but there are laws against indecent exposure so breastfeeding should be banned along with anything else in those laws"" that doesn't apply because the laws specifically exempt breast feeding from them and breast feeding in public is specifically allowed in all but one state. ",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides concrete evidence and statistics to show that breastfeeding is not considered indecent exposure in the majority of states, and even in states without specific exemptions, laws still allow breastfeeding in public.

"You've developed a theory based on your own family and community, and anecdotes from some national figures and events. But the question is, does the theory represent the majority of North American Jews.

In my experience it does not, and I also see plenty of national figures that support my position, such as for example [Chomky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Political_views), Jon Stewart, [Schulman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Schulman#Activism), etc.; Jews are very active in the BDS movement; and there is of course [J Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Street) and so forth.

Why is your experience different from mine? Well, you mentioned ""my synagogue."" It is very possible that your theory is right about more religious Jews, but a lot of Jews in the US are non-religious and never or almost never go to a synagogue. They are also much less supportive of Israel and far less likely to think Jews are persecuted.

You might be right that the Jewish **religion** focuses a lot on persecution of Jews (which makes sense, it's how Jews survived), but it simply is [not a big factor in the lives of many or most Jews in North America today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews#Observances_and_engagement): Even of Jews that consider themselves ""strongly connected"" to the Jewish religion, less than half belong to a synagogue. And more and more Jews just don't care about religion, considering themselves only ""culturally Jewish"", 20% in 1990 to 37% in 2008, and by now that number is even higher.
","You have to remember that many Jews alive today were actively persecuted and discriminated against in North America. By chance I just just finished reading an article about Jon Stewart where he describes being bullied for his religion as a child. Clubs still excluded Jewish members and Jews were still treated as very much separate from the rest of society.

"Boxes:

* stack neatly (if the sizes match, which they are standardized)
* give you cardboard which can be used for crafts or educational purposes.

In addition, boxed-cereal brands typically:

* provide better reading material/activities on the back of the box
* contain better ""prizes""
* have more entertaining ad campaigns, which in turn fund other types of entertainment.

I don't know if that's enough of a difference to merit the price difference. (And honestly, almost all, even ""healthy"" breakfast cereal is diabetes-bait. I'd stick with a nice omelette or steel-cut oats with sea salt.)","Boxed cereal stores better in that you can stack them. The extra price is that you are paying for that storage and for a brand name.

"As a former iTunes user, I know how you're feeling - I had a library of thousands of songs that I no longer use. I think it all boils down to a cost-benefit analysis, and how quickly you like to add music to your library.

Using iTunes is free, but you have to pay about a dollar, give or take, for each song (less per song if you purchase an album). With Spotify Premium, you pay $5 per month for unlimited songs. So, if you regularly add more than five songs a month (which I do) then Spotify is definitely worth the fee. The crux of this issue is that it doesn't matter how many songs you *already have in your library*, but *how often you add new ones*.

Although I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that Spotify has a free version (if you can stomach the drawbacks) which offers most of the same benefits. Theoretically unlimited music library for free - hard to beat that.","Cost analysis.

Lets say over the next 2-3 years you plan on buying 500 new songs. If you are buying them as singles, that could easily be $500 as ($1 a song).

Spotify (free version) would already be an upside. Now lets say you want to play your music when you are not at home, and do not have your devices with you. You could use any computer and log on to your playlist and songs.

"1.  It is unreasonable in a republic to expect an elected body to be a rubber stamp.  In as much as they are elected by the people they represent, Senators have a duty to exercise their powers to meaningfully represent them.

2. This is a republic, not a democracy.  The objective is to have governance accountable to the people, not to have the people's will on every issue immediately enacted.  The Senate has been a valuable part of good governance in the United States, and there is great benefit in not rushing to pass legislation on the barest of legislative majorities.

3.  The Senate is not able to be gerrymandered because of the fixed borders among states.  This is a major problem for how representative House seats are.  For instance [in 2012, Democrats got 1.5 million more votes for the House than Republicans, but more Republicans were elected by a large margin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012)

4.  There is value in having a small legislative body whose membership does not change quickly.  There are a lot of members of the house, which means few of them have much negotiating leverage over bills, and cannot exert influence over leadership.  Further, because they're elected every 2 years, they constantly need party support for their next election.  Senators have more time in office, and are in a small enough body where their one vote can make a meaningful enough difference to get changes.","To the extent that your concern is that the Senate is *actually* a forum for small states to block the rest of the country's people from deciding on federal matters, I would argue that the Senate is at least better than the House in this respect.  Because of demographic sorting, gerrymandering, and disproportionate representation of small states, the House gives hugely unequal weight to the opinions of rural and suburban voters, and undervalues urban voters.  Hence how in 2012 House Democrats could actually receive 1,000,000 more popular votes than the Republicans yet walk away with only 46% of the seats.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more comprehensive argument in favor of the Senate's role in the U.S. government.

"Since you're from Germany I looked for some European sources for my argument, which is that regulating everything so that the risk comes to 0% is *extremely* expensive so it's important to look at the risk factors involved.

Take a look at [this study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/117/3/e374.short) about dog bites from the Medical University of Graz, Austria. (I know it isn't Germany, but it was the best I could find and I think the analysis will still be applicable.) The incidence rate of dog bites among children (which is your main concern) is 0.5 per 1000, which is very small but still worth analyzing more thoroughly. Well, it's the one year-olds who are at the highest risk of bites, and 82% of the dogs were familiar to the children, i.e. family pets. 

Most one year-olds aren't walking around outside unsupervised, they're with their parents when in public, usually being wheeled around everywhere. And, as the article shows, the risk decreased quickly with age. So requiring muzzles in public to mitigate this very minor risk is a huge overreaction.

Edit: Added details about the study.","I don't think muzzles are a good solution to the problem, honestly. Even if you managed to get something like this enacted, it would **have** to be strictly limited to [basket muzzles](http://www.all-about-cane-corso-dog-breed.com/images/muzzles/Rottweiler-dog-wire-muzzle-Handmade-wwell-ventilated-gearM9-big.jpg) which still allows the dog to bite if someone sticks their fingers into the muzzle (most likely children). And even wire basket muzzles can be dangerous or uncomfortable for the dog. I just don't see how that's justified given that less than 1% of dogs will injure a person while out in public.

"&gt;The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. 

So things that make life easier make you weaker?

That's incorrect. Humans have a limited attention span. Making things easier allows you to better focus on important tasks.

&gt;The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong.

So you're saying that learning how to behave from elders leads to you being weaker?

That's also incorrect, humans are much more effective with teaching and aid from adults.

&gt;Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things"", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.

So here you're saying artificially produced reward and punishment schemes are unhelpful and demonstrate barbaric behaviour?

Also incorrect, humans are rational intelligent beings and it's fairly normal for them to create artificial incentive structures to aid proper behaviour, like golden stars for doing well at class, or setting artificial goals like having a bookshelf of a favorite author.

None of your stated weaknesses are actual weaknesses. There are religious groups with genuine weaknesses like jehovah's witnesses who refuse to take blood transplants, or the Hindu practice of followers of the Vishnu Smriti burning widows, but vague non weaknesses don't mean much. If a weakness leads to physical harm then it's a bit more serious, but vague emotional ones mean little.

There are many practices of religious people that humans in general do. Religious people speak. This isn't a sign of their weakness at nonverbal communication. Religious people exercise. This isn't a sign they are wasting calories. Religious people read. This isn't a sign of their lack of sociability. These are all common human traits that aren't weaknesses.","&gt;The need for an afterlife

&gt;The need for moral guidance in life

Doesn't the fact that not all humans 'need' these indicate that it isn't a 'human weakness' (if it is indeed a weakness)?

"&gt; never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing.

"I think robotics (AI and prosthetics) are just a middle step for us and won't last, therefore we are more likely to meet advanced organic life. As someone else said, a more advanced robot will become more and more like an organic life form as it increases in complexity and redundancy; it would be easier to just start with organic life. Currently it is easier to build a prosthetic arm but in the future, when medical science advances, we would rather grow our arm back and grow it stronger. 

 Considering long space journeys, a very advanced organic life would be at an advantage over a robotic life form. Organisms have the unique ability to self repair on the micro scale, something I don't think robots will be able to achieve with the same efficiency. Robots could develop some kind of nanites but they would be separate parts needed to repair damage while in organic life every single part of the body is used to make repairs. An advanced robot would need a power source and replacement parts to survive while organisms need only food/water. On a long journey, a robot colony could run out of parts. They could do some limited recycling but only organic life can achieve a perfect recycling system. A perfect system in which waste is consumed again after some re-energizing process fueled by the ship. Advanced Organic life is more likely to survive a space journey

Edit: I should have clarified that I know food is energy but it is easy to grow and doubles as the physical material of our bodies as well while robots would need separate things. I'm assuming that a ship capable of interstellar travel would have a lot of power to supply to its inhabitants so maybe to robots just need a way of storing power within themselves between charges.

Right now, robots are durable because they're simple- metal skin instead of a network of cells, no reproductive machinery, etc. As they get more complex, they inevitably gain new failure modes and become less durable.

"The cited research states that these findings apply to most contemporary Americans. While having a gun for protection is certainly not a rational choice for most Americans, it is a rational for some Americans. For instance, individuals in extremely rural areas.

When accidental shootings or unnecessary violence happens it is because of ignorance and poor decision making, not because of the gun.

"The flaw in your reasoning, here, is that you seem to assume that the purpose of Reddit is to create an open and equal platform for people to discuss different opinions and points of views. 

This was ***not*** the function that Reddit was built with in mind. You are criticizing a sports car because it sucks on off-road terrain; yes, you technically not wrong in your criticism... but that criticism is still misguided.

So it will be near impossible to ""change your view"" and convince you that the points you raised are not true; instead, the view you need changed is your view of Reddit, itself.

Reddit was not built to be a platform for discussion and debate of differing views. It was built as a platform for users to come to and share and/or find the best content. Who decides what is the best content? The users do. And they decide by upvotes and downvotes.

Really there would be nothing unique about Reddit of or wanted to build a platform that encouraged discussion of different--and often unpopular--points of view and treat then equally.

These platforms already exist, and they are called forums or message boards. There, you have no upvotes or downvotes; if you want to disagree with somebody, you have to do it in a reply. In this setting, all comments--and by extension, all opinions and views--are functionally treated equally. 

So you really need to take another look at Reddit from a much different perspective than you are and understand what the system was built to do. It wasn't built as an alternative message board/forum platform. The discussions that take place here are actually a small subset Reddit's usage. I don't have the hard data to back this up, but I suspect the majority of Redditors only visit the site to find content that they **want to find** and **expect to like**; they don't come here to find opposing views or ideas that challenge their own beliefs. 

This is not an objectively good or bad quality of Reddit, it is simply the nature of the beast. No, Reddit's system does not encourage opposing viewpoints or unpopular opinions to be presented on an equal playing field... but that wasn't what it was intended to do, anyways.

When posting or commenting on Reddit, you do so knowing that you are submitting it for judgement by the masses. This is a risk you take. This may be seen as a potential negative, but it also has beneficial effects by discouraging useless contributions. 

If you see the nature of Reddit being fundamentally flawed, then perhaps you should reflect to determine if Reddit is really the correct platform for the type of discussion/community you want.

But can you really fault Reddit for not doing a creating an environment it didn't **intend** to create? ","You can challenge popular opinion to learn things you might not know since it led you to your question.

Debating for a long enough time can come to a conclusion if you're not too defensive. Since you can't know the truth all by yourself, debating can serve other purposes than just have a winner, it can let all participants learn something they did not know.

While it's true that you won't be able to ""fight"" all the redditor's opinion by yourself (and why would you even do that in the first place ? are you crazy?), posting and reading is actually a good way to take, give back and share in a fast and precise manner that the internet allows.

The only real problem is how strongly your opinions are and how much ready you are to listen to people you disagree with: you have to point them where you disagree, and let them show you why they disagree with you. It's a tedious process, and if you don't have any patience it won't lead you nowhere.

After the 2008 crash I could say I was quite angry, but to be honest I learned a lot of things through reddit, it really allows you to challenge your ideas if you're ready to forget your views a little. It's way better than just reading wikipedia.

"Here in Switzerland we have people as young as 10 years old that join gun societies and learn how to shoot Stgw 90 assault rifles for fun and for marksmanship.

Its not a switch you flip at 18 that makes you more responsible, if a kid isn't allowed to learn until they are 18 and can go out and do it on their own (which plenty will, being teens) the danger will be higher.

The first is the utter lack of empathy. Having a child with sever medical problems is incredibly taxing. It could happen to anyone through no fault of their own, and as such we have decided as a society to spread that risk around to limit its severity. 

The second flaw is ignoring the fallout from not assisting in any way.

"Well, to start off with, there's a big divide between biological sex and gender. I highly recommend you research this more, but I'll try to touch on the basics.

Sex is rooted in an organism's DNA, and is defined by which reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) they produce. Animals with testes who produce sperm are biologically male, and animals with ovaries who produce eggs are considered female. You're probably familiar with X and Y chromosomes, which is how sex is determined in humans, right?

Actually, things go wrong. [Swyer Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_gonadal_dysgenesis) is a big example, in which a person has an XY chromosome but something goes wrong with the Y. Humans are actually female by default, and the Y chromosome is required to activate in order to form male parts. Without it, people with Swyer develop uteri, vaginae, and other normal female organs. However, they have streak gonads which don't produce sperm OR eggs. So what do you call them? Their chromosomes say male. Their organs say female. But they can't reproduce as either one. This is just one of many examples of conditions that show how sex is not even nearly as straightforward as it seems when everything goes normally.

So, this is only half the problem. Now we need to address gender. While there are several definitions of gender, some of which address biology, the accepted definition in most of the social sciences is the combination of external and internal social features that are associated with masculinity or femininity. These usually, but not often, correlate with sex. But for obvious reasons, people who lack an easily definable sex might also be hard to correctly gender. But, clearly, these people aren't genderless, they still have elements of masculinity and/or femininity. That leads us to the question: if gender can be rooted in something that isn't biology, isn't it always rooted in something else, at least partially?

The easy answer is a person's feelings. Hormones, body structures, socialization, and a thousand other things can feed into how we perceive our gender, leading to the inevitable conclusion that gender is determined primarily by how we act and how others act towards us.

Imagine, if you will, that you find out tomorrow you actually have two X chromosomes. I'm assuming you're male, or at least you think you are. But for all you know, your genitals are the product of elaborate surgery when you were an infant- you actually were born with a vagina and streak gonads, but your clitoris was large enough that doctors were able to turn it into a penis and give you testicular implants. I'll admit, it's far-fetched, but in the end it's very hard to know our sex for certain until we've conceived a child or had serious testing done. But let's assume it happens. Would you immediately ask for breast implants, get your facial hair permanently removed, and start dating men while considering yourself straight? Probably not, right? Your gender goes deeper than just what you understand your body to be.

Similarly, if you were abducted by aliens and had your sex switched against your will, do you think you would still identify with your prior gender?

Now, don't get me wrong. There's a heavy correlation between sex and gender for a reason, and part of that is biology. Testosterone does correlate with aggressive, masculine behavior. But there are plenty of aggressive women, right? And while pregnancy does cause mothers to form a tight chemical bond with their children, there are fathers out there who form just as close of an emotional connection without being pregnant. Our bodies might make it easier to act as our gender, might give us the right chemical cues and biological urges, but they do not define everything we feel.

Furthermore, gender isn't even so much about feelings as it is the way we act. Crossdressing proves this- a convincing crossdresser knows how to present themselves as the opposite gender, to the point where few people will ever guess their sex doesn't ""match up"". Have you ever wanted to wear a dress, just to see what it's like? Wished someone would bring you flowers or pick you up for prom or be the big spoon? Maybe you wanted to wear pink or high heels or makeup? You could even enjoy baking or childcare or color-organizing your sock drawer, for all I know. Ovaries don't make someone any more likely to enjoy the color pink than testicles do, these things are based in our personal preferences and how we were socialized as kids.

Being transgender means that your genitals don't match up with the gender that you relate most to. Most of us have some preferences and behaviors that don't line up with our gender, like tbulldykes. They are clearly able to have these masculine feelings, preferences, and behaviors while still identifying as a woman. However, is it so hard to believe that they could have a few more of those preferences, pushing them into predominantly masculine territory? People fall all over the spectrum; we do a lot of policing to tell children what they're ""supposed"" to do and like, but if you watch toddlers at play when they're still too young to have this solidly internalized, you'll see there are a good number of girls who run with the boys and boys who play house with the girls. Being transgender later in life is just like that on a more complex scale, having preferences that are mostly feminine when you have testes or masculine when you have ovaries.

Basically, our bodies don't define what we think, feel, and do. From a biological standpoint of sex, maybe we really can't change. But from a social and cultural point, it's not only possible, it's fairly easy.","&gt; Gender identity should be based upon the genitals with which you were born with and the hormones your body naturally produces.

Based on the standard meaning of these terms, this view is... almost ungrammatical?

Gender identity is (by definition) a person's sense of their own masculinity and/or femininity, and the degree to which they perceive themselves as a being more like a man/woman/both/neither.  Gender identity is entirely subjective, so  _should_ doesn't makes sense there in terms of a prescriptive statement.  Or, to put it another way, what anyone else thinks about whether a person is a man or a woman is is something _other_ than gender identity.

The word _should_ does make sense as a causal statement, in that ~99.9% of people have a gender identity and hormones that match the normal pattern.  (It's worth noting that the genitals a person is born with are determined almost entirely by hormones and related gene regulatory systems during embryonic development)

&gt; From a purely medical/biological standpoint, it doesn't seem as if one should be able to claim to be the opposite gender when scientifically they have been classified to be the other

Since the word _gender_ is used to refer to social and behavioral qualities, I'll assume you're really referring to _sex_ here.  Actually, the biological development of two different sexes in humans isn't as clear cut as you might think, as demonstrated by the existence of a plethora of different types of intersex categories.  For example, chromosomes don't always match up with hormones or external genitals.  There are people with XY chromosomes who are born with vulva/vagina, and there are people with XX chromosomes who are born with a penis.  Some people have XXY chromosomes, rather than XX or XY.  Due to the way human developmental biology works, these people are typically externally male.  

Sex is a set of biological characteristics that typically go together but don't always.  Quite a few of these biological characteristics can actually be (biologically) changed over time with hormones.  Skin, body hair, fat distribution, musculature, breasts... these are all things that change, biologically.  Once that change has taken place, the result is often very similar to siblings of the target sex.  Transgender men grow body and facial hair, build muscle more easily and in different places, their voices drop, they smell like cis men, get male-pattern baldness, etc...  The skin of transgender women softens and they grow breasts typically about a cup size smaller than cis-women siblings.  If the transition starts before something called   Once these changes take place, the scientific/biological classification of them as men or women becomes less clear.  Scientifically/biologically speaking, they become inter-sex.  Hormones change almost everything other than primary reproductive organs.

&gt; for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?

Several cultures have recognized trans- and/or third genders since more or less the dawn of recorded history.  Other commenters have probably mentioned the hijra and native-american two-spirit people as examples.

&gt; This post isn't meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated. Thanks for any responses that can help me understand.

Ultimately, trans-men cannot become cis-men, and trans-women cannot become cis-women.  If you wanted to classify them as accurately as possible, you'd have to say they were inter-sex by choice, but in many ways closer to the sex typically associated with their self-identified gender.  Since typical language use doesn't communicate all this information, it's best just to go with what (1) respects the person's self-identification and (2) is probably closer to anyway.

If you are interacting with a person who has a full beard, bald head, deep voice, strong upper-body muscles, and acts like a guy, don't you just default to using masculine pronouns and names rather than asking about their genitals first?  Yeah, the reality is more complicated, but referring to that person as a man is ""less wrong"" than referring to that person as a woman.  And constantly being more specific (1) emphasizes that person's difference, probably in a way that's very hurtful and (2) puts them in danger of potentially being discriminated against (or even violently attacked) for being queer.

TL;DR, transsexuals become scientifically/biologically intersex, and while the reality is somewhat more complicated, the transformation is sufficiently robust that it's ""less wrong"" to call trans-women women and trans-men men than vice-versa.

"Let me give you an analogy: if you were a gamer in the ‘90s, you surely remember all the third party accessories for the Playstation and the Nintendo 64. Mad Catz controllers. Performance memory cards. (Every generation of game consoles has this stuff but this particular gen stands out in my mind for it.)

On paper, these third party accessories were great. A Mad Catz Playstation controller was pretty much identical to a first-party Sony controller. Mad Catz controllers were cheaper too. But they were poorly made. They regularly fell apart or just stopped working. To get that lower price point, corners had to be cut.

I don’t know enough about controller design to say *why* Sony’s Playstation controllers were better. All I know is Sony controllers didn’t break in 6 months.

"I think your alien analogy is problematic.  For one thing, I wouldn't take the deal and neither would most people.  There is an awful lot that we'd be missing out on - and there is an awful lot that these animals are missing out on.  They do not self-actualize (to whatever extent an animal can ever be said to self-actualize).  And they ain't living to 50.  Lambs may be killed at age 5 instead of age 12 (as /u/Vorpal_Kitten pointed out), but 12 is still a terrible deal.

The reason free range meat is ok (if it's indeed ok) is not that we're giving these animals a good deal.  It's that we're treating them humanely.  We aren't chaining them to their stall.  We aren't hurting them.  They live a life free of misery.  The idea isn't ""hey you'd really rather us eat you than not"", it's ""we aren't torturing you"".  

When you consider which of these justifications better shows our morality, consider the question of fertilized eggs.

"I could write two dozen things in opposition to this, but just to gather a few basic points.

-You should understand, if you don't(seems like you don't), that what you're referring is [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), a field of thought that has existed for about as long as Darwin's theory of evolution has has a long, *very* sordid history.  Most notably, it was one of the primary justifications for Nazi Germany's genocidal practices.

-Despite it's attractiveness to certain political persuasions, [overpopulation is simply not a concern with legitimate scientific backing](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation).  In fact, if the world continues to increase on its path of modernization, democratization and secularism, *under*population is the issue we will have to be concerned.  In highly educated, relatively prosperous societies, birth rates become lower and lower, to the point where they are now beginning to become lower than death rates in some places.  In America, if you excluded immigration, the population would not be growing.  In Japan, it's shrinking and aging outright.  It's only because of the poorer places in the world that population continues to grow substantially, and even then, the worldwide birth rate is shrinking slowly every year.

-There are any number of political oppositions I have to this but I won't get to deep into them as ultimately that's my ethical viewpoint vs. yours.  Needless to say, I think measuring the value of a human being wholly by their ability to produce and work for their country is a fascist viewpoint, and the ability of an individual to pass any kind of mental or psychological test(which undoubtedly would be designed by rich white people) is strongly dependent on the situation and opportunities they grew up with, so it doesn't even remotely approach an accurate genetic test.","You are complaining about humans not letting evolution take place (I'll come to that too), but at the same time you want to counteract what humans evolved to become - supportive of the weak.

The fact that humans help each other out and save the weak (first in tribes, now in nation states) allowed humans to take over the world. You help me now that I'm weak, I help you another time when you're weak. We both survive, instead of neither of us surviving. Remember, it's survival of the fittest, and fittest doesn't necessarily mean strongest.

Now, I don't see how we're not letting evolution take place. Evolution doesn't mean that in every generation only the strongest are allowed to survive. Evolution means that the genes which are most likely to survive through multiple generations in bodies that are likely to reproduce are likely to be spread the most. So if being determined enough to acquire sufficient wealth to be able to reproduce even if you are fat means that you are more likely to reproduce, then that means that that's a gene that's likely to spread, and that's evolution.

And if you really want to solve overpopulation problems, there's far less radical ways to solve that (development help for third world countries etc.). Or just kill everyone who is too old to reproduce.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more comprehensive and well-reasoned argument against the OP's viewpoint.

"There are three justifications for the price differences for children under 13. 

First, teenagers and young adults attend the movies more often than any other demographic. That group is over represented - People from 12-18 represent only 8% of the population but represent 16% of the movie going audience and 18 to 24 year olds represent 19% of the audience but just 10% of the population.  However, children under 12 are underrepresented - they make up just 7% of the typical movie going audience while being 14% of the population. (By the way, these stats are from 2010 since I couldn't find anything more recent).  The only other group that is significantly underrepresented are seniors. 
So the theater industry offers discounts to those underrepresented groups needs to incentivize them to attend. Thus, we regularly see discounts for senior &amp; children 12 and under at movie theaters.   However, since teenagers are showing up in numbers already, it doesn't make sense to target them with a discount. You want them paying full price.  

Second , as was mentioned above, is that a lower child price targets families. It's essentially making attending the movies as a family less expensive and thus more attractive option.  Other groups - a pack of teenagers for example - are less likely to consider the total cost for the group since they will be paying for their tickets individually. However,  families are going to be very aware of the total cost since they will not be paying individually.  And, they will be comparing that total cost against other entertainment options. So a teenager might be asking ""is it worth $15 bucks to see this movie with my friends"" while a family of four  is asking ""is $60 worth it to see this movie.""  Once you start considering that total cost, it may not sound like much of s value. So, theaters improving that value proposition with a discount makes sense. 

Finally, I'd argue that in general the younger a person is, the less they get out of a movie. Now, that's not true for all movies. But, if a parent is considering attending let's say a typical drama, I think you would conclude that your 11 year old might not appreciate or understand that movie well enough to justify the $15 a full priced ticket will cost.  That is not to say the child won't get any enjoyment out of that movie, but a lower price might convince a parent to bring a child that they wouldn't for full price. Also, and I think more importantly, that parent might not attend that movie unless they can take their child (think single or stay at home parents, or just those unwilling to attend the movies without their children).  Now, like a said, I don't think this is true for every movie, but for certain movies a discounted child ticket price can be justified by young children being less able to appreciate those movies. 


 ","It's about attracting customers. If a parent is going to take their kids somewhere, cost will certainly be a factor. If they have to pay full price for multiple tickets than it might make them choose somewhere else to go. By giving a discount for young kids they attract more business from parents. 13 or so is about the age kids start going to movies with friends instead of their parents. Sure they are still borrowing money from their parents, but now the few extra dollars for a ticket isn't as big of a deal since they are only paying for one ticket instead of 2 or 3 or however many kids they might have.

"So, I think ""meaning"" is kind of just a byproduct of our evolution. Because, the way you're talking about it is sort of the way most people address this concept, like it's some sort of transcendent sentiment, that there's a purpose that can exist forever and we're not a part of it and that eternal purpose is the only important thing.

You know when you're sorta YouTube surfing and you start on some silly video and later end up on a 2 hour documentary on some huge scientific conquest we've done in the last decade sometimes? Or sometimes, it's the opposite, but often, you'll watch a video about puppies playing patty cake with cats and then suddenly **here's all the physics ever.** (EDIT: So re-reading this, I realized that at this part, I accidentally did it in the same order twice so it's not the opposite at all but I'm sure reddit will forgive me just like they forgave that one guy who misspelled his name)

One of those videos I watched, I think, was about what's outside our observable universe. It started out with stuff outside of what we can see because of expansion, and that was like ""meh"" because it was mostly, as far as we can tell, just our stuff, same composition, pretty uniform except for some cold spot that could be evidence of a multiverse or something. And then they started talking about the multiverse. And how there are totally different temporal dimensions that our temporal dimension exists in and how our ""forward"" in time is ""up"" one level up or some crazy arbitrary dimension.

Like, you just sorta realize that time is **totally and completely arbitrary.** People put so much emphasis on time being such a huge thing, like if we don't last until the end of the universe in 10^gazillion millennia or whatever they calculated it to be, we don't matter, but no, it's just another arbitrary dimension, it's like saying that unless I'm really, really fat, I don't matter and I'm totally meaningless because I don't take up as much space in this dimension.

###So...
___

Being dependent on time is so, so arbitrary. Time is just a randomass mechanic that our minds just sorta found it convenient to interpret. I mean, everything about our universe is just interpretations. These colors are just radiation. There's radiation going directly into my eyes right now and some physical law has allowed a mysterious thing called consciousness to emerge from the soup inside my head to make what we call an image out of that. Time is like color, we're just looking at entropy and somehow, the evidence of less entropic states enters each of our consicous states in order to make memories.

My take on this is if there is a meaning out there, you wouldn't know. Meaning, as far as I can define it, is ability to have some sort of effect. I'm not sure if logic even exists outside of our universe, like I don't know if true and false are just suddenly not the only states of things outside here, but as far as I can tell, the best definition is having an effect, and when you have rigorous laws and logic, everything you do affects everything. The universe is just a structure, time included, just like a bunch of blocks you put together to make a Jenga tower that relies on every piece to stay up except Jenga is literally the opposite of that, but everyone always uses it as a metaphor for engineering so w/e. That's what Chaos theory is, if you change anything or remove anyone, suddenly the universe doesn't exist. It's gone. If someone from outside the universe came in and made you not exist, literally the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is gone. Aliens outside of our observable universe but still in our universe would just, without even knowing why, also stop existing because they rely on your existence.

That's fucking crazy, like, right now, some pregnant alien overlord is worried about their leadership and their baby and they're not worried about me at all, but if it weren't for me RIGHT FUCKING NOW being a thing, they would be freaking DEAD. They don't even KNOW.

I'm not even sure I'm trying to change your mind at this point, I started typing and then I just got really enthusiastic, but yeah, you really should realize that

###TL;DR (Honestly, don't read the above, it's a ramble because I fucked up and I'm too lazy to fix it)

""not lasting forever means we're meaningless"" is so super duper arbitrary when you realize how non-unique and special time is. It's just, like, another thing. Like a burger. It's like saying if I don't always have everything to do with this burger, I am meaningless, from cow to slaughter to consumption. Why a burger? Why not a sandwich? Or a late night television show? At the very least, if we're meaningless, it's not because we won't last forever.","'Human existence is futile.' But to find meaning is what makes us human. To be an animal without hope of overcoming death is certainly meaningless.

As animals it isn't logical to think we were 'cursed' with the knowledge of our own future demise. 

We fear death in the same way we fear pain: it motivates us to do something other than bang our heads against the wall. In order to escape the fear of death we seek transcendence; we raise children or create art to effect the next generation. Example: the 'mid-life crises' is caused by 1) getting older 2) feeling you haven't influenced the next generation positively. Some people try to 'make themselves feel younger' via sportscars, drinking, etc. which always fails.

Being a mere beast is futile.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a unique perspective on the concept of meaning and existence, tying it to the arbitrary nature of time and the universe. The analogy of time being just another dimension, like color, is thought-provoking and challenges the traditional view of meaning and existence. Additionally, the explanation of how every individual's existence has a ripple effect on the universe is a compelling argument for the significance of human life.",0
"The Clinton thing doesn't concern me.  Bill was President from 92 to 2000. Hillary's riding his coattails.  She fought tooth and nail during the 08 primary for the democratic nomination and lost fair and square to Obama.  She wants to throw her hat in the ring again, and that's her right.  Chelsea Clinton hasn't followed her parents into politics, aside from stumping for her mother, so it's unlikely there's a political dynasty in the making.

The Bush thing is more an anomally than a trend. George Sr. was a successful politician, was elected Vice President on the Reagan ticket from 80 to 88. (it's important to note that VP of the US has litte official power, just to cast the tie-breaking vote in the senate, and to replace the president if he dies), he was elected president from 88 to 92.  He had two kids that followed him in to politics.  I don't think there's much doubt that both benefited from their dad's name in early campaigns, but nepotism only goes so far.  His campaigns were orchestrated by political genius/satan incarnate Karl Rove, who knew exactly how to brand him, and ran effective smear campaigns in governor, primary and presidential races.  That is, his winning strategy was to make the opposing candidates look bad rather than bringing attention to his own.

Jeb on the other hand went the florida route.  He did his bachelor's in Latin American Studies and is fluent in Spanish.    he made a name for himself in florida politics and accomplished a lot, probably due to his own merits as much as the family name.  He's being tapped as a possible presiential candidate, not just because of his name, but because of his conservative voting record, he can appeal to traditional conservatives as well as (they hope) the Hispanic population, which is an increasingly important voting bloc, they are generally socially conservative but still vote more democratic.  However, unlike George W Bush, the family name and association with his brother may be more of an uphill battle in the presidential election. ","Firstly:  if you have a problem with either another bush or another clinton, you should have a problem with both.  Personally, I'm a republican so I hate Hillary, I should like bush, but I really don't want another bush in the White House, and as stupid as the republicans are I think they're smart enough to not try to put another bush in the White House.

Secondly:  it's just our political system.  Forgetting names (because arguably we can take this to the ""first"" political dynasty in America with the Adams Family), how we elect a president is fair, and if the people vote for the dynasty, we will get a dynasty.  If the people vote for Marco Rubio, or Bernie Sanders, or Rand Paul, then the people will get one of them, we don't have to have a political dynasty.  Also, a little pointing out, the democrats are going to push Hillary, she's the strongest candidate they have, but there are too many people who don't like Hillary.  

Anyways it's only a bad thing if the American people say it's a bad thing.",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a broader perspective on political dynasties and the role of the American people in choosing their leaders. It acknowledges the potential issues with political dynasties but ultimately leaves the decision up to the voters, emphasizing the importance of their choice in shaping the political landscape.

"In some cases yes I see where you are coming from, but I don't see it with Down syndrome. These are people who don't have a significantly decreased lifespan, there isn't a lot of pain or discomfort associated with it, just in general people with Down syndrome can go on to live long healthy lives.

If you are talking about situations where an infant only has weeks or months to live and that time was spent in agony then you would have more of a point IMO","Ugh, OP, you picked some of the worst examples of ""living nightmare diseases""!

People with Down's Syndrome have a huuuge range of qualities of life. They could be mute and hardly able to control themselves, or they could be like [Jamie Brewer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Brewer), able to speak and live an awesome life as a famous actress. Don't tell me Jamie Brewer is living a torturous life, go check out her interviews and clips of her acting.  

I've also seen many videos / blogs / interviews with people with progeria and harlequin ichthyosis and they are happy and having fun. Honestly I think you only picked those two because they result in the person being subjectively ugly to you, making their conditions seem worse than they are.  

There are so many cases in life where people are told they'll never walk again, and then the next year they're walking. Or someone is told their baby will never advance past age 2 mentally and never reach milestones and then 10 years later they're just like all the other kids. There are also women who are told their unborn child has a fatal / terrible disease but it was a misdiagnosis and there's nothing wrong with the baby.  

Your argument is based on a purely subjective opinion about quality of life. You also base quality of life on things like appearance and length of life. Think about what ""living Hell"" really is. Do you really think these kids who have those disease, who have friends, are going to school, acting in movies, running around the park, going to Disney Land REALLY suffering every waking moment and wishing they were dead? Of course not. We have NO WAY to accurately judge the quality of a person's life, so why risk killing someone because we THINK they MIGHT be unhappy?

"I love coffee. If given the choice, I'll have freshly roasted beans that I just ground made in a very particular way that takes me about 3 minutes/cup. This is one of my favorite parts of my day- although, admittedly, partly because I enjoy the ritual behind it. However, I enjoy most coffee- I will even enjoy a cup of Starbucks brewed coffee. I love, love, love to drink it and have enjoyed it since I was very young. However, I guess you can just tell me ""you are lying to yourself"" and I guess there is no way to address that. But I will address a few things you said:

&gt;Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. 

So are you saying that this is the only reason people enjoy alcohol and tobacco? By this logic, do people not really enjoy adult movies, sex, or driving? After all, those are all things that are age restricted as children and that children wouldn't really enjoy anyways. Why is coffee different than them?

&gt;Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? 

If what you say is true, probably. A frappe at Starbucks doesn't count. So your only experience is instant coffee and specialty house coffee.

Instant coffee is only real coffee in the way that tang is real orange juice. It tastes sort of like coffee and gives some of the benefits, but it isn't actually coffee. If someone who had only ever had tang said ""I don't like orange juice,"" you would probably say ""you have no idea if you like orange juice- you've never tried it."" I would say the same thing about instant coffee. Go out and have some real coffee before you judge the beverage.

I have no idea about the shops you have been to. But many of those specialty coffee shops serve very strong, sour, and bitter coffee. Which is great if you are into it, but is a poor introduction to coffee. They are the equivalent to blue cheese. If someone had only ever had blue cheese before and said based on it ""I hate cheese,"" you would probably say ""you should try something milder before making up your mind."" I would say the same thing about coffee: if you have only tried strong specialty coffee, go try some milder coffee before you make a judgement.

So, go try some real-but-mild coffee. A light roast at Starbucks would actually be a decent one to try. Then make a judgement. You may still not like it yourself, which is find. But even if you don't like it, you probably won't find it as gross as the fake stuff or the super strong stuff. It should help you wrap your head around why some people like it.

&gt;It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. 

There are two reasons some don't think Starbucks is real coffee. First, because most of what they sell isn't actually coffee. The Frappe you order is a great example- I love them, I really do. But it is closer to a milkshake than a coffee. 

Second, many don't like the decision they make with their brewed coffee and espresso (ie: real coffee). Starbucks is kind of like McDonalds- consistency is more important than quality. They want you to experience the exact same taste every time you go in. They aren't as bad now, but they still do it to a degree- they burn their beans. This gets rid of a lot of the flavour profile in them. This has the plus of making every batch of beans taste the same, it has the downside of taking out a lot of the nuance. Personally this doesn't make me hate Starbucks coffee. It just makes me not enjoy it as much as I would other coffees. It's kind of the difference between having a marinara sauce that came out of a jar and a marinara sauce that someone home cooked all day- the first one will be fine, but not nearly as delicious as the home made variety.","On top of what's already been said, the reason why 'espresso connoisseurs' hate Starbucks is because they burn their beans (over-roast them) which produces a strong bitter taste, and then they overload it with sugar to mask the bitter taste. This is fine if you don't like the taste of espresso

Starbucks is like it's own subdivision of espresso centered a bit more around the sugar. And that's fine, and clearly tons of people enjoy it enough to make it the large enterprise it is. But the people who've had and loved actual espresso, and learned to enjoy the taste of it, will be shocked upon trying Starbucks to find that the espresso part of the drink tastes like shit, and there's way too much sugar. It'd be like enjoying fine local craft beers all your life, then being thrown a Bud Lite. Sure, Bud Lite is popular, but it doesn't have what someone who enjoys craft beer is looking for. Or lets say you grew up having fresh, delicious hamburgers from the cows on your farm along with fries from potatoes you grew at home, then you had a McDonalds Big Mac. Shit, I love myself the occasional McDonalds, but it scratches an entirely different itch than homemade hamburgers and fries.

I know I'm sounding pretentious. I really have no problem with Starbucks. Just trying to explain.

",1,2,False,Response 2 provides a more concise and relatable analogy to explain why 'espresso connoisseurs' may dislike Starbucks coffee. The comparison to enjoying craft beers and then trying Bud Lite or homemade hamburgers versus McDonald's Big Mac is more straightforward and easier to understand for the OP.,0

"It seems like you're saying two different things here. I agree that the argument that someone should vote purely because it's their patriotic duty is a pretty poor one. 

But people that have little interest in politics shouldn't be discouraged from voting, they should be simultaneously encouraged to vote and to educate themselves about the candidates before doing so. 

There are numerous quizzes online so that even the incredibly lazy can best match their views to a candidate that shares them by answering questions on key issues. There's no reason why someone should be discouraged from voting due to lack of knowledge or interest when the option exists to help them cultivate knowledge or interest.","I think, as with all views on issues with democracy, that it helps to understand what the purpose of democracy is: It's not to get a good form of government that synthesizes all of the best ideas of all of the people to result in an optimal outcome.

A competent, benevolent dictator can be more or less proven to be a better way to achieve the ""best"" government. The problem is that dictatorial systems always eventually lead to a bad dictator, and a big reason for this is lack of checks and balances.

The purpose of democracy is to prevent bad dictators. It's to be a check and balance on oppressive and terrible government. That's all. It's pretty terrible at anything else, but luckily that seems to be enough.

People should vote whenever they feel that it's important to vote, for whatever reason, because that's how we execute the checks and balances on government that democracy enshrines. 

You can be the stupidest, most ignorant person in the world, but if you're offended by something the government does, and you want to replace it (even with an random choice), then you are serving the purpose of democracy by voting: preventing bad dictators.

"I think the central issue with this type of view is the idea that the life a severely disabled person has is not ""good."" Certainly it is not ""independent,"" but who is to say it is not ""good?"" We don't know whether severely autistic people are generally happy or miserable--often they do not express happiness the way neurotypical people do but may report experiencing it. After all, autism is a communication disorder. We can't really ""share the experiences"" of someone with severe autism. And, of course, there are many other disabilities where we encounter the same question. We've no way to know whether they are enjoying themselves and their lives, because we can't ask in a way they understand and they can't tell us.

Now, I'm not talking about people with devastating, painful medical conditions who CAN tell us how they feel. I believe in assisted suicide for the terminally ill and greatly suffering. But I don't think we can reasonably extend that to someone who by definition cannot tell us if they are suffering or not.

Edit: You also mention the negative impact a child with a severe disability has on the family. While this is very sad, if it wouldn't be grounds for euthanizing any other child, why are disabled children different? What I mean is, if my family were suffering greatly because we could not afford to feed a child, say, or because we were overburdened by regular childcare needs, would we be able to euthanize the child? If not, why not, if effect on others matters? I'm not trying to make a slippery slope argument, I'm asking why a negative impact from a disabled child is different from a negative impact of a non-disabled child--which, depending on circumstance, could be equal or lesser.

Edit2: If you've come to tell me I don't know anything about taking care of disabled people, save it. I worked in a care facility and my brothers are autistic. I guess it isn't clear: my alternative plan to OP's euthanasia is not ""parents should suck it up,"" it's ""we should have a social safety net for this type of situation, including in and out of home care for these families, because that's what social safety nets are for."" There is no need to tell me that these families suffer because it is impossible to provide round the clock care--that is obvious to me.","1. Children are not their parents' possessions. A parent raising a child in their custody has a lot of control over that child, but they do not own them.  They therefore do not have the right to terminate them.  They can, however, give up their rights and responsibilities as a parent and surrender the child to adoptive parents, an organization, or the state.

2. 5 year olds may not be able to take care of themselves, but they still have inner selves, personalities, hopes and wants and fears.  The same goes for those with conditions like severe autism. That has value, even if they cannot live independently.

3. You cannot predict the future.  Some treatment may arise that drastically changes their ability to function.

"&gt; Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. 

I feel like this is a biased definition of sex: sex can be a recreational activity, but it is not *only* a recreational activity: it has procreative, romantic and emotional elements. It's often hard to separate these.

&gt; Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have.

This feels like a misinterpretation of what it means to have your bodily autonomy respected. You *are* free to have sex with other people while in a relationship in the sense that someone cannot actually prevent you from doing so without committing a crime or directly violating their consent in some other way. You are not free, however, to tell other people how to feel about this: that's not what bodily autonomy is.

"&gt;I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental and physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

I think this is a simplistic view - Let's be honest and not politically correct - Providing sex services to strangers is not the same simple task as flipping burgers, cleaning stairwells and cooking, cleaning etc. Having sex has impact on people not because of taboo but because it is the most intimate act you can have with someone and it obligates you to share yourself at least physically with someone else. The problem with no other options available is that prostitution is not as easy as other jobs. Certainly it may be easy to please most Johns, that's not the issue, the issue is that it's not an easy call. Can you imagine yourself working for the sex industry and being required to do a certain amount of dirty things with whoever shows up, as your only option for survival? 

Yes, it is better than being homeless but it's troubling that people need to provide sex services to survive. It's not easy. I actually have a friend who worked in escorting - The payment is great so it was overall a good experience, but she described as being harsh specially on the psychological side because it's not easy to have sex with strangers and do most things they require

&gt;If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""Desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I agree that it's taboo, but as I said it's not just that - For some people it is easy to have sex for strangers, for others it's not. Being a man myself, I don't like having sex with strangers and I prefer to be committed first - It's a preference (before you ask, no I'm not religious). For most people, having sex with anyone who asks for it is not an easy task.


I am divided on prostitution - But I believe it should be decriminalized at least. My problem with regulating fully is that there's no evidence that it does solve the issues it promises to solve.

Do you think it's ok that the majority of prostitutes according to many studies start before the age of 18? Do you think legalizing and regulating will erase issues?

","I agree that sex work should be legal, but your methods don't seem like they would be sufficient for harm reduction. Because of the high up front cost of running and regulating a brothel, you'd see them institute a robust hiring process that would screen out many current sex workers for a variety of reasons, perhaps most commonly the fact that they arE homeless, undocumented, or simply  won't look ""good"" enough to attract brothel customers.

"&gt; I feel that posting armed guards at schools would directly deincentivize any individual from going to violent crimes at schools.

Not if the person has no intention of staying alive throughout the ordeal. 

&gt; And if the individual wanting to commit is suicidal than the armed guards would directly solve the problem and stop the would-be gunmen before the tragedy even starts.

How do you figure?  They're not going to know whom to stop until there's a reason to stop them.  

I understand the desire to keep schools safe, but let's be honest with ourselves here.  School shootings, even in the US, are pretty damn rare.  School is meant to be an environment of learning, broadening one's horizons, and feeling free to pursue knowledge.  How are we ever supposed to convince kids that school is worth anything positive if they have to start every day by going through a metal detector and dodging police in riot gear?","&gt; It was never given a reason why people look down upon it. 

Because it costs too much money? Most schools can barely pay for teachers, much less full-time armed guards.

The school districts that can afford armed guards don't need them, and the ones that do need armed guards can barely afford to pay teachers.",2,1,False,Response 1 provides a practical and logical argument against posting armed guards at schools by highlighting the economic infeasibility of doing so.

"I had a really long counterargument, but I lost it all.  So I'll spare you and give you the short version.

It's kind of counter-intuitive to view things like the low cost of exported resources or the low cost of wages as being exploitative of developing countries.  Those are economic advantages for those countries and allow them to compete globally, even when they may have poor infrastructure, dysfunctional governments, etc.  And, ideally, they disappear slowly as a country develops, giving it time to adjust and plan for the future as it's economic situation changes.  

It's also important to understand that low wages don't mean cheap manufacturing.  Currency exchange really comes into play here.  China is a good example.  For a few years a while back, it was artificially deflating its currency to make it more attractive to offshoring.  The stronger the renminbi was relative to the dollar, the less cost effective it was to move manufacturing there.  After they ended that practice, you saw companies like Motorola even move manufacturing back to the US, because high tech, low labor factories in the US were nearly as cost effective as low tech, labor intensive factories in China.  The Moto X was reported to have cost only an additional $4 a unit to be manufactured in the US.

On the flip side, rising costs from developing nations does not make Western lifestyles unsustainable.  As those countries get wealthier, their middle class grows.  A growing middle class means more people who buy Western goods. Have you ever wondered why GM kept Buick around after it's bankruptcy?  It sits awkwardly between Chevrolet and Cadillac.  A fully optioned Chevy will often cost as much as a comparable but less featured Buick and a fully optioned Buick starts getting close to Cadillac pricing territory.  Buick is incredibly popular in China.  GM will slap a Buick badge on a crappy, cheap car from Korea and it will outsell anything they offer in the US.  So margins may get thinner, because resources and manufacturing get more expensive, but overall revenue increases because the market grows larger.  

That's not to say that it would be sustainable for *every* country to be on the same economic level as the US.  I don't know how well that would work.  But a Western lifestyle would not be harmed much by bringing the world up to, say, the middle class standards of China.","Countries go through a development life cycle. Initially, they are under-developed and poor, with low wages. However, those low wages are a competitive advantage, as goods can be produced cheaply there. So multinational companies move their factories there. That abundance of new jobs, even if they're poorly paying from an international frame of reference, are better paying that what the people use to do. Then secondary industries pop up. Restaurants that cater to the factory works, for example. Some of those restaurants succeed, some fail. Those who own the ones that succeed, make money. Also, people who succeed in the factory become managers. They send their kids to get better a education than they received, and thus they get a better skill set. That better skill set from a more educated populace leads to more skilled labor. More skilled labor leads to better paying jobs, as now companies that require skilled labor will look to the country, because even skilled labor will be cheaper there then elsewhere. Eventually, skilled labor becomes the comparitive advantage for the country, and some other underdeveloped country becomes the low skill, low wage location.

This is how the world works man. It's what's happening in China, as suddenly Chinese wages are higher than say, Vietnamese wages. This keeps on happen as countries develop.

Technology plays a major role in how quickly this happens. It's also about to flip the whole thing on it's head, as automation starts to reach new heights. Soon, labor won't be anywhere close to the requirement it once was to create finished goods, and capital investment (into machines) will become much, much more important. This leads to jobs, (although less than there were originally) returning to capital and infrastructure abundant countries, like the US.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of how economic advantages for developing countries can lead to global competition, the impact of currency exchange rates on manufacturing costs, and the growth of middle classes in developing nations benefiting Western economies.

"I think the root of this comes not from the feeling that women are weaker or defenseless against men, because even if a woman is much, much stronger than an individual man, I suspect that the rape of that woman will seem worse for you than the rape of that man.  

I think this attitude comes from the purity aspect of women; Women's bodies are temples that they are the overseers of, at least in our western society.  When and if she chooses to allow someone into the temple, it is in some way devalued.  

Mens bodies aren't seen the same way.  The are seen as inherently the defilers, and not as something pure that can be devalued.  This even applies to gay men raped by other men; They just don't have that inherent purity to be stolen that a woman, any woman, has.  

If we sit back and examine this, and the purity culture that produced it, we have a chance to see that from the standpoint of the individual that is overpowered or tricked into an intimate activity there is no difference.  Internalized purity culture is the reason women may feel worse about being raped than men do, and why we are more sympathetic to them, but the net result is the same- use of our physical self by another person against our will.   ","Well for one, many men are penetrated against their will very much in the same way that women are raped. This can either be with an object (by a woman or man), or by another man.

"The main problem with your argument is that gays are a *class* of people, while people with incestuous feelings are just individuals with incestuous feelings.

Basically, it is wrong to discriminate against people simply because they belong to a specific group. It is, however, perfectly OK to discriminate against individuals because of their individual traits.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect_classification#Federal_classifications) are some of the legal definitions of what constitutes a 'class' of people. I'm not going to summarize 'em. You have to do some work and read 'em yourself. But the two main groups are the suspect classes and the rational-basis classes. *Suspect* classes include race or religion, and the government needs to show a compelling reason to allow discrimination. *Rational-basis* classes are groups like criminals vs. non-criminals, where there may be a rational reason to allow discrimination.

Two choice quotes:

&gt;In Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in its Findings of Fact commented that sexual orientation could be considered a **suspect** class[...]

and:

&gt;Striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in Windsor v. United States (2012), the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held sexual orientation to be a **quasi-suspect** classification

Here you have the courts arguing over which kind of classification that gays belong to (*suspect* vs. *quasi-suspect* class) but agreeing that gays do belong to something stronger than just a rational-basis classification.

Siblings with incestuous feelings? I guarantee they would fall under the 'rational-basis' classification, meaning there is a lower bar for the gov't to clear in order to justify discrimination.","&gt; marriage is not about reproduction. 

This is true, and I'll grant that a key component of the recent ruling was that marriage cannot be distinguished based on a couple's ability to have, or preference for, children. So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there's a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. 

I imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it's wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a clear and concise argument based on legal definitions of classes of people, highlighting the difference between discriminating against a class of people (such as gays) versus individuals with specific traits (such as incestuous feelings). By framing the issue in this way, Response 2 effectively shows why discriminating against gays is not justified while discriminating against individuals with incestuous feelings may be more acceptable under the law.",0
"Let’s start with your framing position!

To begin with, Jesus’ pre-incarnate status as divine is (based on the biblical text) poorly understood at best (although John certainly though he pre-existed). Positions have been argued most vehemently both ways, but his pre-incarnate state is, to us, basically opaque. I’ll not take a position here, except to say that the way you framed this question would have to be considered pretty speculative. Let’s work with what’s recorded, instead!

To talk about Jesus’ sacrifice and why it might be important, you’d have to talk about who he is, and what he represents. You’ve alluded to this in your question, but what do we mean when we say Jesus is the Lamb of God, and why does that matter?

Jesus is the Messiah; that is, he is God’s anointed (in the same way as Saul, David, and Solomon) to be God’s king and representative to the Jews. There had been many, many other anointed in the past; every king of Israel was messiah. Jesus was claiming that office. The miracles of Jesus’ ministry are in part signifiers of his credentials. That is, he’s demonstrating that he actually is sent on God’s authority.

The difference here is that Jesus is pushing for an expanded understanding of God, His law, and His kingdom. Jesus in the gospels is claiming to be the king who is prophesied to usher in God’s kingdom and begin the rule of God on earth. His claims and stance, coupled with the miraculous signs like healing, caused a high degree of polarization in the contemporary Jewish community.

That said, let’s take another look at your framing question, as it seems to be the foundation of your perspective. As you’ve set it up, it kind of sounds like Jesus is saying “Heigh ho, better pop off to Earth for a spot of the old redemption, what? Oops, pesky humans, with their crucifying! Well, back to eternity; at least the blighters have a chance now.”

Instead, let’s take the text at face value and look at it as Jesus is recorded to have done. This is a man who should have been treated like what he was, a prophet of God, a king and Messiah, and the representative of God to man. If those things are true (and we’re assuming they are for this argument), then respect and devotion are certainly appropriate responses. Jesus’ entire ministry is him pushing people to a clearer understanding and a refined relationship with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This would all have been well within the understanding and history of the contemporary Jewish culture Jesus was in. There’s even precedent in the prophets for what Jesus was doing.

Now, it seems clear that Jesus himself knew that he would be killed. He alludes to it throughout the gospels (I shall raise this temple in 3 days, etc.). When we get the garden of Gethsemane, however, Jesus is incredibly stressed. He clearly does not want to be crucified, to the point where he is sweating blood. This is where we can answer your question with more accuracy. Jesus is not doing this because he wants to or because it’s easy. In fact, in the text, he’s not even doing it to save humanity. In Matthew 26:39, he asks not to be killed, and says that he does this because  it’s the Father’s will.

So, whatever Jesus’ pre-incarnate state, whatever else he might have done, however the kingdom might have manifested with his continued survival, in Christ’s crucifixion we can understand the term Lamb of God. This is a reference to the lamb of the Passover, the sacrifice whose blood on the lintel will signify your obedience to the Lord, and thereby spare you from death. It’s a reference to the Exodus, and God’s salvation of the Israelites from bondage. In the same way, Jesus’ sacrifice frees us from the bondage and slavery of sin.

The merit in the sacrifice is that Jesus, so far the only human being who lived as God intended (that is, without sin and prioritizing God’s will),  is brutally executed *while doing God’s will*. His life and the manner of his death signify and confirm his authority from God, and that empowers him to be our representative, at once satisfying to God as doing as an actual human ought, and understandable to us because he’s from our context.
Just to reiterate, in the Scripture Jesus is acting like a human. There are things he doesn’t know. The power he uses is from God. He’s scared at the prospect of his execution. These are not the traits of an aloof divine being going through the motions. For Jesus, it’s not a sacrifice of no value, but a protracted and painful (and humiliating) death.
The next logical question is to ask why a sacrifice is necessary at all, and that’s a tougher one to answer. From the old to new testaments, sacrifice and death are always used to redeem sin. My understanding is that it’s an illustration of the seriousness of sin and its consequences, but I’d understand if that answer failed to satisfy.
Anyway, hope that helps. I really rushed through this; there have been books and books written on this subject. If anything was unclear or you’d like more info, I’m happy to expand on any details.

TL;DR: Jesus wasn’t a detached divine being, according to the text. His sacrifice was at great personal cost. He was God’s representative and rightful king of Israel (indeed, all the world), and therefore should have been treated as such rather than being wrongfully executed. His perspective was not one of giving away 30+ years out of a million billion, but rather one of being God’s faithful servant within a limited human lifetime. The merit in his sacrifice is that he did God’s will in his life to the point of unfair death at the hands of those he came to help, and that makes his sacrifice sufficient to repair our relationship with God, from God’s perspective.
","I'm very much a wild man in my faith, I wander the whole world's ideas and beliefs in search of truth. I was raised as a (Presyterian) Christian but had to reject all of it at a certain point in life. My return to Christianity has been very much a surprise, and made possible by setting aside everything that other humans have told me about God and Truth... including the Bible. I do still read the Bible, and seek out the perspectives of others. I also read many, many other things.

Christ's death is the least relevant part of my experience of the divine. It's a little irreverent to say that, but it is just where I am at. I have heard the explanations and sermons, *ad nauseum*, about why Christ's death was a big deal. There's a lot of history involved, for one, about the prophecies and emotional-spiritual undercurrents of the Israelite/Jewish peoples and their journey and evolution. It takes quite a bit of research to really grasp in its true extent, given how insanely long ago all of this happened. (The cultures and peoples in question, and the world in general, looked radically different. Plus there's a language barrier to overcome.)

Also there are theological perspectives, built and expounded upon since Christ's death, which some people are really into. Christ being a bridge between humanity and God, Christ's death absolving all sins, all sorts of things that I have listened to at some length over the course of my life. And these things are ok I guess. I like some more than others, connect with some more than others.

But compared to the living truth I have met, the living spirit of consciousness and Life, the weird and wild and true Grace that has flown into me, and taught me what friendship even means, and shown me love and intimacy beyond what I could have hoped for, introduced me to intimacy in the first place ....ahhh it's truly incredible. Indescribable! Compared to this experience and love, the knowledge about this very ancient event, the death and resurrection of the man named Jesus, is well, just knowledge. It's an incredible story, and good to learn, but it's a little weird I think to focus on it so much. 

I'm sure my perspective will change subtly over time, but Christians focus so much on death and sin... they do so in order to show how God saves us from them. But if that's the case, why not frame it according to that premise? Talk about life and grace! That's more like how the spirit is with me.

Just, pure grace. Pure soul. Pure music.

So while I have, in a way, not directly addressed your claim, I wanted to share my experience. There is a living spirit, call it the living spirit of Truth, or call it God, or call it the elegant cosmos, but realize those are just sounds we make, little squiggles we write down that try to correspond to a much huger reality than can possibly be contained in mere squiggles, in mere perturbations of the air. This living spirit is a Great Friend, is a deep well of Truth, Light, and Love. Instead of trying to use 2000 year old information (which wasn't recorded very well at the time, which was notoriously and shamelessly edited by political bodies, which was copied over and over by scribes who introduce small but Telephone-like errors, and then translated once or twice across languages) to evaluate the nobility and admirable-ness of Christ or the spirit which filled the man, probe the here and now. Ask the living truth to show you its nobility. Ask Christ to show you here and now whether he is admirable. And, crucially, wait for an answer.

(Though this can be done alone, you might need to find a counselor, priest, artist, weirdo, musician, sheik, guru, yogi, or shaman to guide you through the morass of thoughts and feelings that keep our eyes shrouded.)

I highly recommend reading (or re-reading) The Chronicles of Narnia. Aslan is to me a better portrayal of Christ than that given by most of the New Testament.

"I'd say a few things. The first is... what's a 'traditionally white' role?

Second... along the lines of the logic behind affirmative action... which is to say that it's socially important for POC (to use your term) to be seen in positions of power and respect because it promotes the normalization of equality. Where there's a role that is not race-dependent, it's good to be reminded that POC have all the dimensions we have seen white actors depict.

"The problem here is that economics simply don't work that way. You can't just legislate away supply and demand; the demand part here is what's critical.

What you've said is basically ""the voice acting is good but not extraordinary, the plot is good but not that good, the art is really good but still bested by other anime, it avoids most major pitfalls...""

What makes this anime *fantastic?* what makes it stand out above everything else? What makes it *unique?*

---

A side note: I would warn you against using an anime's Netflix ratings to determine how great it is. Critic ratings and similar are probably much better.

When a Netflix watcher rates a series low, it's because they personally didn't like it. Remember that Netflix gives you suggestions based on your ratings of previous movies. It actually has a message that says ""did you like this? If so, give it lots of stars and we'll suggest more similar!

I watched about 3 episodes perhaps a year ago. I hated it. I was expecting a shonen story with lots of interesting fights and battles. Instead, I got so much chat, development of relationships, and tearful good-byes, and so little *fighting,* that I thought I had stumbled into a gay romance anime.

Not that there's anything wrong with gay romance anime. But I don't like them, I don't want Netflix suggesting them to me, and so I gave it a low rating and moved on.","I just wrote a big post and then realized you were only talking about the first arc :/. The first arc is pretty great but I feel a lot of potential was missed out on and I would put a lot of more expanded and complete . I know it is based on the light novel series but feel that the anime could use a western comic book style reboot/reimagining. The original light novel was written as a stand alone work and the author did not anticipate how successful it would be.

The reset would create an expanded anime in the setting of Sword Art online with an expanded focus (as in some episodes featuring Asuna and others without Kirito) that fills in the details of the over two year timespan of the over two year life of the game. So many things weren't explored enough like Kirito's beater status and people's negative perceptions of him, how Asuna's character developed to be so strong, the solidification of the Knights of the Blood Oath along with development and foreshadowing of Heathcliff's very important character, and making the game feel like more of a world overall. 

I feel if they did that and made it end when the game ended would allow it to contend as one of the greatest anime's all time. The anime right now suffered from not developing enough plot lines and from the way it is dragging on. ",1,1,True,Response 1 is more persuasive because it directly challenges the OP to explain what makes the anime stand out and be considered one of the best of all time.

How do you find common ground?  If you somehow do, how do you get the votes to pass it?  How about the 1st amendment?  What does free speech mean now?  How about religion?  I could go on, but most of the amendments would have people trying to redefine them, and I don't see enough common ground to get any of it done.

And there is more!  How about delineating the powers of the branches of government?  Generally, we would probably want something more specific, but what would it look like?  How about the specifically delineated powers of the federal government?  What are the new ones?  It is a very anachronistic list, but what to replace it with? The electoral college?

"Here's a small list:

* I like how manuals handle much better than automatics. I feel more in control of the car. 

* Manuals can get better marginally better gas mileage on some cars. 

* Another point that is kinda tongue-in-cheek is that not a lot of people know how to drive stick so your car is less likely to get stolen. 

* Engine braking can extend the life on your brakes significantly. 

* Manual ~~engines~~ transmissions are simpler and easier to maintain. 

* Another I forgot originally, You can pop the clutch if your battery dies. (or your alternator is on the fritz)

I prefer manual transmission. I get some people don't like shifting in traffic or whatever, and that's fine for you. But I learned and grew up on one so it really is second nature and makes absolutely zero more conscious effort for me. Benefits of the manual:

- Better gas mileage, no question if you actually know how to drive a stick.

- More control over the car. Going up on down a mountain? Change to the gear you're most comfortable in based on what the slope is doing at the time. Erratic traffic pattern? Pop to a different gear when you need a quick jump to sneak between cars. In the auto the car decides what you need and is based pretty much just on RPM not letting you do those control things.

- Downshifting is mechanically easier on your car than breaking

- Manual transmissions tend to have a longer life and are easier/cheaper to repair because they are simpler

"I am a huge fan of cycling and try to do it whenever I can (I wish I worked in my city).  However, the reason cyclists should follow the same rules as cars is primarily for the overall safety of the cyclist. 


I believe there are a great deal of cyclists who are actively aware and very good at navigating traffic patterns.  But just as with drivers, not all cyclists are actively aware, especially those places with prominent bike share programs.  Factor in drivers in metric ton vehicles.  Many times they are not very aware, not actively looking, and actually lack a great deal of field of view to their surroundings especially if they're tourists visiting the city and are not used to driving around with bikes.  If a car collides with a car in the city, they are rarely traveling at a velocity that causes serious injury to each other or the persons inside.  However, a bicycle moving at 15-20 mph, if even clipped, can have a devastating effect on the rider.  By filtering you run the risk of getting ""doored"", turned into, or hitting a pedestrian you may not have seen past the vehicle.

Trust me, I know the frustration of having to come to full stops.  But traffic laws exist to create predictability and rules of conduct to make drivers safer.  By not following the expected rules of the road, your unpredictability creates a significant statistical increase in chances of an accident, which the negative results of are greatly increased due to the lack of protections a bike has versus a car. ","This is very hard to address without knowing specific rules you would like to change for bicyclists. However, [the League of American Bicyclists](http://bikeleague.org/content/rules-road-0) suggests that the first two 'rules of the road' for bicyclists are to:

* Follow the law
* Be predictable   

When bicyclists follow the laws that automobiles are expected to follow, they maximize their personal safety. For example, on streets without bike lanes and with insufficient passing room, the law allows bicyclists to take the entire lane of traffic, just like any other vehicle. I do this myself in order to enhance my safety while riding. Conversely, when bicyclists ignore laws that they feel are applicable only to cars, they jeopardize their personal safety. For example, [this bicyclist chose to ride the wrong way down a one-way street](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article22429800.html), and they nearly paid for it with their life.

In addition, following the law dovetails with being a predictable rider. That is, it is important for bicyclists to follow all rules normally expected of motor vehicles because doing so ultimately allows motorists to anticipate how bicyclists will proceed in any given situation. If bicyclists are given their own set of rules to follow, it makes it that much more difficult for drivers to safely respond to the presence of bicyclists. This is especially true of drivers who don't ride bicycles and thus would not be intimately familiar with the differences in these rules. 

As an analogy, think about renting a car in another country—you might be able to discern the basic differences in road rules by reading about them beforehand, but actually driving under those rules can be pretty hairy. If you have to worry about memorizing all the exemptions for bicyclists, it reduces predictability, reduces reaction times, and ultimately increases the potential for accidents. 

Furthermore, when bicyclists start following different rules, they become unpredictable. For example, when bicyclists ride on the sidewalk, drivers who are turning often do not see them because they do not anticipate them. This hugely increases the risk of left/right hooks. And, pedestrians do not anticipate bicyclists on the sidewalk and often do not see or hear them coming. You make the argument that road conditions often aren't safe for bicyclists, and that bicycle crashes only harm the rider—[but when bicyclists ride on sidewalks](http://videos.syracuse.com/post-standard/2015/02/cortland_bikepedestrian_crash.html), [or when bicyclists ride through red lights](http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Bicyclist-sentenced-for-fatal-S-F-crash-4736312.php), they risk colliding into and seriously injuring or killing pedestrians. 

Finally, the best solution for the problems you identify is not to introduce separate rules for bicyclists, but rather is to beef up bicycle-specific infrastructure. Road markings and road signs are the overriding consideration for vehicle behavior! Using intelligent road markings and other infrastructure to maximize separation between bicycles and motor vehicles will do far more to promote safe bicycling than introducing new rules will.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of why it is important for bicyclists to follow the same rules as cars, emphasizing safety and predictability. It uses examples and analogies to illustrate the potential dangers of not following the rules of the road. Response 2, on the other hand, focuses more on the consequences of not following the rules without providing as much reasoning or evidence to support the argument.",0

"Your information about pack leaders, hierarchies, alphas, and dominance among dogs has been debunked.

One quote from a Time article:

&gt; The debate has its roots in 1940s studies of captive wolves gathered from various places that, when forced to live together, naturally competed for status. Acclaimed animal behaviorist Rudolph Schenkel dubbed the male and female who won out the alpha pair. As it turns out, this research was based on a faulty premise: wolves in the wild, says L. David Mech, founder of the Minnesota-based International Wolf Center, actually live in nuclear families, not randomly assembled units, in which the mother and father are the pack leaders and their offspring's status is based on birth order. Mech, who used to ascribe to alpha-wolf theory but has reversed course in recent years, says the pack's hierarchy does not involve anyone fighting to the top of the group, because just like in a human family, the youngsters naturally follow their parents' lead (http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2007250,00.html)

"You're expressing a matter of aesthetic philosophy, rather than the rigid formalism of science. In chemistry, an 'element' is any atomic structure, no matter how short-lived or unstable.

Your point of view is understandable from an entirely unscientific perspective, but from a chemist's perspective it's like suggesting that humans who don't make it to adulthood have no place in human records, because they didn't live to a certain popularly accepted arbitrary point, or that food that's only produced in kitchens instead of occurring on its own has no business being called food. And there are in fact people who have those views, so I'm just picking weird ideas out of the air. I chose ones that are really out there, in order to provide a more realistic perspective.

A scientist is unconcerned with whether an element is found in nature or not. What does that even mean? In the decay series of many materials, many transitional elements *do* occur naturally, but don't stick around. Many of the elements that have been synthesized in laboratories *used* to exist naturally, but had short-lives too short to still be around this late in our planet's history. Plenty of elements are forged in the final moments of a star's life, but only last an instant. Do those elements 'exist in nature' or not, and according to whose criteria?

Likewise, how long they last is also arbitrary. A millisecond is tiny for you and me, but it has no aesthetic or qualitative meaning to anything else.

"&gt;The Christian genesis story states that god created man in his current form

Where EXACTLY is that stated?

Sure one man named Adam is specially created - true. [Genesis 2:7]

But that does not mean that God could not have let humans evolve over millions of years, and then separately created Adam in a form that was similar to the form the evolved humans had. [Genesis 1:26]

Edit: genesis citations.","&gt; The Christian genesis story states that god created man in his current form, while evolutionary theory explains that life took millions of years to evolve and that our species is descended from a common ancestor with the other primates.

Your mistake is assuming that your interpretation of the bible is the only one that is correct. An alternative interpretation is that God created everything in it's current form, but also created it in a *mature* form. It was made this way so that we can look at the world and discover how things will work from that point forward.

&gt; If someone were to claim that only the genesis story is a metaphor but the rest is literally true, then that person has effectively filtered the bible themselves. For a person to pick and choose what is real and what is not in a sacred book is to not hold the book sacred. 

You don't get to define the religion of another person. Seriously. Religion is completely arbitrary to begin with, and your version is no more valid than that of anybody else.",1,2,False,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it challenges the assumption made by the OP about the interpretation of the Bible.

"While I understand where you are coming from, and agree that measures should be taken, I don't think what you propose would be fair or effective because:

* Imprisonment [simply does not work](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/e199912.htm) as a measure to reduce recidivism. At all.

* 7% of inmates [report being raped](http://www.justdetention.org/pdf/struckman.pdf). I don't think you want to be putting people into a situation where their chance of rape is that high without very good reason.

* Legally, the presumption of innocence is enshrined in the US constitution. To presume someone guilty merely on someone's word is illegal.

* Morally, it is better to set a hundred guilty people free than to punish one innocent person. Thus the presumption of innocence.

* Publicising someone's information in relation to an accusation of rape can be harmful enough to them to be consstrued as punishment, and shouldn't be done without a guilty verdict.

I would propose a different set of changes:

* When somebody makes an accusation of rape, ~~assume they are telling the truth  (edit: insofar as that a rape occurred)~~ edit 2: do not assume they are lying, and forward them to detectives trained to deal with rape victims.

* Make sure they have access to any medical or mental health facilities they need. This is the important thing, as punishing someone will not help the victim, regardless of their guilt.

* Investigate in good faith. Collect any available evidence, and where there is evidence, actually analyse it. This is [not what is done currently](http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/unanalyzed-evidence-sexual-assault-cases), which is probably a big reason for the woefully inadequate conviction rates you see.

* If there is enough evidence to prove someone guilty, send them away. If there is not, we can't be certain enough of their guilt to punish them in good faith.

Punishing an innocent person won't help the victim. It will only harm the innocent person. Punishing a guilty person won't help the victim, it will only harm the guilty person.

Stopping rapes in the first place would be the most desirable solution, but I can't offer any magic bullets there.","Our legal system is centred around the idea that it is better to set a guilty person free than to jail an innocent person. If we shift the burden of proof to the defendant, it becomes much easier for people to bring malicious accusations against someone. It is often very difficult to prove that you didn't do something. For this reason, in criminal cases, all the defence must to is argue that the prosecution hasn't made their case well enough; they don't have to argue that there is positive evidence that the defendant is innocent.

If this change were to be implemented, almost everyone accused of rape would be convicted, regardless of their guilt or innocence. This would result in many innocent people having their lives destroyed. It's simply not worth it.

The current system is far from perfect; it makes it almost impossible to get a conviction. That being said, we should focus on making it easier for victims to report crimes. This requires a major culture shift away from victim blaming. Streamlining the reporting process is not a bad idea. Shifting the burden of proof is unimaginably ill-advised.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a strong argument against shifting the burden of proof in rape cases by highlighting the potential for false accusations and the importance of the presumption of innocence. It also suggests alternative ways to improve the system without compromising the rights of the accused. Response 2, while acknowledging the need for change, focuses more on the ineffectiveness of imprisonment and the importance of supporting victims, but does not directly address the issue of burden of proof.",0
"This screams of pseudoscience to me. 

Confirmation bias seems rampant with it. There is twisting of language/understanding of traits that are obvious exemptions to this proposed principle of psychology. 

Where is the hard evidence? Where are the experiments? This is all just sounding like mumbo jumbo guru principles that sound cool in theory; therefore it must be true.

I could also just list several examples that I would find to be complete exceptions to this rule, but a large part of that is just as unprovable as the rule itself. ","People project their appearance and their personalities in everyday interaction, but can hide their past and their proclivities if need be.

We do not worry about hating pedophiles in everyday life because we don't meet someone and think, ""Ted is totally a pedophile, let's hate on him"". We do think ""Ted is super rude, let's hate him"". So the things we worry about hating in everyday life are the things we interact with the most. My aunt who works as a librarian at a federal prison has told me that she won't look up the crimes of the inmates who volunteer at the library, because she looked up one guy who she really liked and learned that he was in for murdering two women. That information absolutely affected her interaction with this man, because she thought he was a kind and helpful guy prior to knowing this. She has the potential to know the worst about the people she interacts with, something that the everyday person does not, and chooses not to do so because it is too emotionally draining. 

I also don't believe white supremacists are afraid that they are secretly black.

Do we hate the same qualities in other people that we hate in ourselves? Yes, obviously. But I can hate rude people, and hate myself when I am rude, but not consider myself a rude person. I'm just more acutely aware of those moments that I am rude and I think about them more negatively, because it is a quality that I don't like in people. I don't go into moments of introspection when I'm being funny, or kind, or conscientious, or any of the million personality traits that I like about myself and others, even if that is how I act most of the time. I worry about the moments where I thought I was being rude because those are the moments I want to fix now and prevent in the future. I always sincerely apologize in these moments and it often negates my moment of rudeness. A rude person would not apologize or would not apologize sincerely. If you hate an act that you do, you will often hate the person who exemplifies and revels in that act. That doesn't mean that you have that ""trait"" it is just an act you do sometimes because you are human. 

Then there are the primary traits that we hate in ourselves but do not hate in others. I don't consider myself a rude person (although I will do something rude every once in a while), but I would say that I am an extremely anxious person. It's the personality characteristic that I hate most about myself, but I have tons of friends with anxiety and I love them more for it because we find common ground in our anxiety. I'd actually argue that a lot of religions are founded around hating traits about yourself and finding a common group that hates those things about them too. 

Finally there are just personalities that are completely discordant. I am a really really bad liar. That does not mean that I don't lie but I don't do it very often and it is for small things that I often to confess to immediately after telling. So I don't consider ""liar"" to be part of my personality at all, but if you look at the people who I have most actively and violently disliked in my life, they all share the common trait of being a compulsive liar. I dislike them more than rude people, which is an attribute I exhibit far more often (and some of my best friends are rude!). It is the complete difference in our personalities that makes it impossible for us to get along. Lies make me uncomfortable as it is hard for me to keep them and they are hard for me to follow. These people would rather live a life that is perceived to be more interesting while I just want someone who will be honest to me. So when I am around them I am immediately uncomfortable and I often unravel their lies in my attempt to get more comfortable. I don't call them out or say they are a liar, I just ask questions about things that confuse me in their back story because it changes the way that I assume the world works (something small like, ""I've been taking the subway 20 extra minutes all this time when there is a good spice shop at this stop?"" And there actually was no spice shop, she just bought it at Whole Foods and didn't think I cooked. WHY ARE YOU LYING ABOUT PAPRIKA!?!?!?!? WHAT IS THE POINT!?!?!). Sorry, I got sidetracked by a fictional story about paprika. Anyway, so either I'm always uncomfortable around them, which I hate, or they are always uncomfortable around me because they cannot help but lie and are always waiting for me to call them out on it. ",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a detailed and nuanced explanation of how people interact with others based on their traits and past actions.

"I will be addressing this situation in the US, where public transit is generally not highly regarded and there is vast infrastructure for personal vehicles. I will also try to avoid cultural biases.
I agree with your sentiment, However I don't view the two as alternatives to one another, nor is either one a complete solution to all transportation problems.
most major US cities would benefit from better and cleaner public transportation. This is held back in large part by the fact that the US is heavily invested in the massive personal transport infrastructure it already has, and attempts to reform the entire system could be very disruptive to public life.
There are also inherent limitations to public transportation. Traditional mass transit is not a good model for the widely-spaced, diffuse populations in a lot of the middle of the country. It is also an imperfect solution for people with disabilities: a member of my family is unable to drive due to visual impairment, and cannot walk very well due to partial paralysis in the leg. Even if suburban public transit provided a direct route from our town to where she works, it would be very difficult for her to make It to and from the station. A self driving vehicle could allow for a greater degree of mobility and autonomy for handicapped people.","One major point that I think you need to consider is personal preference.  Like it or not, most people prefer the freedom to leave when exactly when they want, directly from their current location, and directly to their destination.  These are things that public transportation requires compromises on, often quite significant compromises in the type of environment that most Americans live in.

With that in mind, even if you were somehow able to fund and construct the *perfect* public transportation system, I don't think you'd get anywhere near 100% adoption by the public.

I live in a fairly public transportation ""friendly"" city, by most standards, and while our system is far from perfect, it is fairly extensive.  I find it personally more pleasant to take the bus when going downtown, rather than dealing with traffic.

By the way, while we have a relatively good public transit system, we have a really poor infrastructure for driving.  Everyone here complains about the traffic, and it's only continuing to get worse.  I only point this out to say that my city is probably close to a best case scenario for giving people incentive to use public transit.

However, most people here don't make that same calculation.  Either the slight time loss waiting for the bus on both legs of a journey, or the time lost stopping to pick up passengers, or the inconvenience of buying tickets, or the loss of freedom, or something else causes most people around here to continue to drive.

If a relatively good public transit system loses out in peoples minds to a relatively poor private vehicle system, then I don't think our time is best spent making a good public transit system marginally better.

There's a parallel argument that might make this point better.  A lot of people choose to drive large trucks or SUVs either because they use the hauling capacity for work or leisure, or honestly, sometimes just because they want to.  Some environmental activists would prefer we oppose trucks at all costs, pushing everyone towards smaller and more efficient vehicles, even hybrids if we can.

The problem with that is that we've had limited success so far.  Trucks are still a hugely disproportionate part of the total auto sales in the US.

With that in mind, is it still worth the effort and trouble to continue to fight against human nature and the incentives that push people into buying trucks, or is it better to limit the impact of the trucks that are going to be sold anyway?

We've finally started to do the latter, with new trucks starting to come out with much more fuel efficient engines, lighter construction, and better aerodynamics.  It's to the point that some full size trucks are talking about getting 30 mpg in the near future, which is better than my small hatchback.

I see your argument as something similar.  In ideal world, no one would buy a truck unless they actually truly *needed* it.  In an ideal world, everyone would take advantage of a perfect public transit system should we provide one.

In the real world, people just want what they want for a variety of complicated reasons.  Ignoring that leads to solutions for ideal world problems which totally fail to do anything for real world problems.

"Oftentimes, the OP is the person presenting the most common viewpoint, and it's up to the commenters to find a unique argument against it. I say unique because usually, the OP has already considered the most common opposing ideas in advance. In fact, people present mainstream views so often that the moderators created Fresh Topic Friday in order to promote more unique and nonconforming posts. Furthermore, even though I think it's much more difficult to give a delta than to earn one, the system rewards earning them. That means that everyone is competing to have the most unique and compelling post, and the OP is competing to keep his or her view from being changed. I'm not sure how important  internet points are to people, but the scoring system is definitely set up to reward individuality and disincentives group think. This in in direct contrast to karma, which is often awarded to people who people already agree with. ","this is my experience in this sub: there are many different reasons why people post here. some post to be part of an echo chamber.  some post to defend and strengthen their views.  some are concerned that they are not considering enough perspectives and are looking for alternate views. so my first argument is that you are over-simplifying this sub.

the nature of reddit is present in this sub, what with upvotes, downvotes, etc. but popularity does not equate to deltas.  op decides whether to award a delta. in any case, discussions here typically last as long as the topic continues to get fresh perspectives.  if op doesn't hand out a delta where the popular view is that a delta is earned, or if the discussion devolves into semantics and hair splitting, interest in the discussion wanes.

groupthink depends on the adherence of the accepted opinion as dogma.  challenging these ideas in any real way is out of the question. the entire premise of this sub is to question the views put fourth.

I could be wrong, but groupthink may also be controlled by a fascist regime, which this sub is not.  as far as reddit mods go, r/cmv has mods that seem to prefer the spirit of the law to the letter.  the sub's rules do not seem like they foster groupthink to me.

so, we have a place where ideas are served up for public vivisection.  ideas can freely be challenged and only the op decides whether or not his or her view has been changed.  that seems closer to the socratic method than groupthink.  would you consider the socratic method ""teach me to groupthink""?",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the purpose and dynamics of the subreddit r/ChangeMyView.

"While you may not fully understand the effects of certain actions or words on your own being. Those that do usually suffer from mental illnesses that can cause devestation reflection of an event or memory when brought up. I have ptsd and while i've learned to recognize when i will be triggered it still happens sometimes.

there are people that use this term to gain some sort of control over what others say (tumblrsjw's) and radical feminists of sorts. I first hand know that triggers do exist and i think you should at least acknowledge that they do for some people. sometimes they aren't even words but a situation that will trigger somebody. a few nights ago someone was insulting me because I told my friend ""I hurt myself too much"" and that friends sister went onto her account and started saying that i was a drama queen, that i'm a scrawny white guy who can't even get a job, and other things. That led to a flashback, I am mentally not fit to be in the work force so me ""not being able to get a job"" was a blow to my self esteem that made me spiral downwards into depressive thoughts and finally i had a flashback. now, this is just an example but let me point out a few key things.

1) a part of the reason was because i was already stressed out at the time, i was put into a corner of drama from a few different people before that happened.

2) if there was no stress, I may have been able to identify that i may be close to having an episode.

3) it wasn't 'one word' that caused this, it was a mix of paragraphs of insults.

Triggers do exist and for some they can be far different than others, i do believe someone bringing up rape could 'possibly' trigger a victim into a flashback of what happened, but i doubt that just the word alone would cause it. now if they went to see a movie and there was a disturbing rape scene then that would be more of an understandable trigger. In closing, i somewhat agree with you stating people should be able to overcome our issues. but that doesn't happen out of nowhere in a split second. people struggle for years before they can achieve being better. ","Triggers are certainly real. If you've experienced a traumatic event like rape or witnessing someone's death, there will very likely be something that brings you to a state of distress.

The problem today is that people use the term 'triggered' to label normal feelings of sadness, shame, or embarrassment, resulting in someone who actually has a real trigger not being taken seriously when they say they have a trigger.

Ex. My ex was really abusive and it took almost 2 years of daily full-blown panic attacks to be able to leave the house calmly. Loud noises would set me off, especially doors slamming(I connected this now to him slamming the door when he was mad and I knew I'd be his punching bag). That was an actual trigger for me, but I would never call it that because of all this bullshit tumblrina garbage about triggers. It actually took me almost a year to ask my parents if they could try not to slam the doors because of this. I felt really bad about asking but they were super understanding.

Another, that I still have, is people touching my hair because ONE TIME he yanked me by the hair across the room. I still don't know why I can't get over this one, but it's there and honestly isn't that big of a deal anymore. I just tell people beforehand to not touch my hair and we're cool.

Something that IS NOT a 'trigger' is when someone calls me a bitch or something that he would call me. I just get pissed off at them like any other normal person would. Sure, it sometimes reminds me of when he would say it, but it isn't a trigger. 
For some people who maybe had an abusive upbringing, certain words like 'bitch' COULD be a trigger. But saying it's a trigger for you just because you don't like being called a bitch is just crap.

So yes, triggers do still exist. All this BS you see online about people listing their triggers is just not knowing how to identify with their (completely normal) emotions.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a personal example of how triggers can affect someone with PTSD, which adds credibility to the argument that triggers do exist. The response also acknowledges that triggers can be different for everyone and explains how a situation, not just a single word, can trigger someone.

"I think there's an important distinction between age limits and outright censorship.  ""Censorship"" in the political sense means that you are suppressing or editing a book, movie, or another work on the basis of the words and ideas contained inside it being deemed ""unacceptable"" by some authority figure.  The problem with censorship is that it abridges the freedom of adults to choose the media they consume and to expose themselves to whatever content they want.  


MPAA and RIAA ratings, on the other hand, are age limits that apply only to children under 17.  They aren't removing these movies or video games from the marketplace of ideas, or even preventing children from seeing them.  They are just giving parents the choice about whether to expose their children to those media, rather than allowing children to have that choice themselves.  Rightly or wrongly, children under the age of 17 are under the guardianship of their parents, and our society and our legal system gives parents to make certain choices on behalf of their children until they reach a certain age.  You can argue that age 17 is arbitrary, but I think most people would agree that children below SOME age are not really capable of deciding themselves what media is appropriate to consume.  So then it's just a question of picking where the arbitrary age cutoff is.


Age limits on books are actually quite common.  It is illegal for example, to sell erotica to children, and many bookstore chains have also adopted their own content limits in terms of what books they'll sell to young kids.  Parent groups and others will often force schools and libraries to ban certain titles (or to remove them from school curricula) for putative ""graphic content"" or political controversy.  Morally, this doesn't seem to me much different from the MPAA/RIAA rating systems; the only real difference is that it's done on an ad-hoc basis at the consumer level, rather than nationally by an industry-wide board.


Also, I agree with u/forestfly1234 that the layer of interpretation needed to understand graphic content in books provides another layer of protection (generally, in my experience as a teacher, kids who are old enough to understand what they're reading are usually old enough to handle the content, and the same is definitely not true of movies.)","If you're reading a book you have to interpret what you're reading. If you a six year old read a rape scene and have no idea what a rape scene actually entails you're probably going to not really understand what that scene is trying to depict. 

The kid is protected by not having any idea as to what he is reading, so the rape scene has no context for him. He probably is protected because he can't read the thing in the first place. Books provide protection that movies and games don't.

If I show the movie Hostel to a 6 year old the violence is already really dedicated for him. That kid just has to sit back and watch. he isn't protected by his ignorance. Everything is just laid out to see.

"The thing is... an average/normal adult human is a *person*. An unborn fetus, while it may be ""human"" doesn't meet the criteria for personhood in most situations.

Many popular arguments involve the idea that human life isn't necessarily valueable, but *personhood* is. And that whatever it is that people value about human life - it's really just personhood that they are actually valuing.

&gt; you are robbing the child of the years of life it could have had. having an abortion in my opinion is just as wrong because the 2 year old and the unborn child have almost the same likelihood to live out a full life and taking that away from either of them would be morally unjustifiable.

Killing a child/adult (usually) involves killing them against their will/choice. That's usually considered murder. An unborn child has no will and is incapable of choice, however. This is an important distinction - and the one many think is the relevant distinction.

You also can't attempt to maximize potential life... otherwise it would be ""wrong"" to masturbate and waste sperm... in fact, it would be wrong for women not to be pregnant all the time after puberty. A woman who has only 2 kids vs having 12 kids is depriving 10 potential humans of life! But this is a nonsensical path down a road with a very silly end. 

There is nothing intrinsically ""right"" about maximizing the quantity of human life - and if you believe otherwise, then I'd like to hear an argument for it.","Why do you we disregard the life of the unborn child if the pregnancy was the result of a rape? Why does how the fetus was conceived influence the rights we give it? You can't hold the argument that human holds importance over anything else and then make an exception in the same paragraph.

It seems to make more sense to determine rights base on agency. A fetus is just a clump of cells, it doesn't think, have memories, or an identity.

"It entirely depends on your situation. If you have no music library building up 1000 songs (legitimately) will cost you roughly 1000 dollars.

"You're not following through the game theory of optimisation.

Take the Prisoner's Dilemma. As you know, the confession is always (by design) the best individual result for the actor with all things being equal, _assuming the game is only played once_.

In a sequence of games, and with the ability to form a cartel with the other prisoner, the net benefit to an individual by arranging to both cooperate outweighs the single gain of betrayal given sufficient iterations, because betrayal ensures the cartel breaks and you end up back in the both-confess situation. 

All of society is in essence a multiparty cartel; agreeing to cooperate ensures a greater personal reward in the long term, and is thus the rational self interest to pursue - your betrayal of the cartel by pursuing short term personal interest by exploiting the others leads to them punishing you by refusing to cooperate back.

",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a clear and logical explanation using game theory to show how pursuing rational self-interest in the long term benefits the individual more than short-term gains. It also addresses the flaw in the OP's argument by highlighting the importance of cooperation in society.

"This article will support your premise that few people if any are beyond looking attractive -- given the right treatments.http://www.themysteryworld.com/2012/04/there-are-no-ugly-women-only-poor-ones.html?m=1

However, your stipulation that it's ""their fault"" if they are ugly is where you trip up. The experiment in the article provided these women with all the beauty treatments known to man, regardless of cost. Cost, and time, are important factors. Not everyone makes enough to afford the beauty treatments and fashionable clothing needed to make them at least a 7 out of 10. 

Are you arguing that it's their fault if they are poor, or just middle class? 

Also, a lot of people are allergic to makeup -- I am. (And don't day there are hypoallergenic kind of makeup. That's more about marketing and much less about reality. And it's all expensive.) 

And flattering clothes are not cheap. Even if you can find them at thrift stores, it will take a long time. If you are raising children and working and perhaps caring for an elderly relative, you don't have time to comb through tons of items at Goodwill. 

It might be a person's choice to take care of dependents rather than doll themselves up. But it's hardly their ""fault"" for not being able to look good without reneging on their responsibilities to others. 

You're right that a large part of attractiveness is time and effort rather than genetics. But you are wrong to blame the people who don't have the time or money to make themselves attractive.","A lot of those things you mentioned (acne treatment, fashionable clothes, hair treatment, gym membership to lose weight) require money.

The problem here is that without details, these promises don't mean anything.  Anyone with half a brain can figure out how to reduce the budget (simply by cutting services). But a candidate who wants to reduce the budget by cutting military spending is a much different candidate than one who wants to reduce the budget by cutting education spending.

Look, everyone wants lower taxes.  Pretty much every candidate I've ever seen in my entire life has promised to lower taxes in some way.  Frankly, I'm not interested in such a meaningless promise.   Unless you can explain, on at least a basic level, how you plan on lowering my taxes, I can't take you seriously.  Maybe you want to cut the military, maybe you want to cut education, maybe you want to raise the corporate taxes.  Until you give me some indication on how you plan on doing it, and at least some basic figures to back them up, I can't tell if I support you as a candidate or not.

"&gt;  At the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states.

You've glossed over the absolute biggest deal breaker on the list.  US currency is not measured by a gold standard.  Our currency is based on speculation.  That speculation is almost entirely based on a name/reputation. If the country is dissolved, the currency is reevaluated again.  Upon reevaluation it is impossible for it to divide into even halves.  The different parts synergize to create a result greater than the sum of it's parts.  The division would result in a plummet in both economies.","The problem is that we aren't divided on a nice and neat state level. Have you seen the [Purple America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_America) map? You can have liberal districts (often but not always containing cities) inside of states that strongly disagree with them, or conservative districts (often but not always more rural) inside states that are seen as liberal, and even beyond that things can be close (shades of purple instead of bright red and blue).

So for example Northwest Oregon would want to be part of the ""United States,"" but as soon as you get outside of the Multonomah/Clackamas region and Lane county the state would probably want to be ""America."" This is pretty common throughout the country, with bastions of one side or the other even inside ""strongholds.""

If you divide at the district level you will have a total mess, with enclaves surrounded by other countries and going back and forth between two countries ever county line!

"From Wikipedia:

""Tranquillizer darts are not generally included in military or police less-than-lethal arsenals because no drug is yet known that would be quickly and reliably effective on humans without the risks of side effects or an overdose. This means that effective use requires an estimate of the weight of the target to be able to determine how many darts (if any) can be used. Shooting too few would result in no effect whatsoever, while too many can kill the target. According to James Butts, Santa Monica, CA Chief of Police, ""Tranquilizing agents don't affect everyone uniformly. Therefore you cannot predict whether or not you have a sufficient dose to tranquilize the individual. Second, any tranquillizer will take time to enter the bloodstream and sedate the individual. If someone is advancing on you with a deadly weapon or a threatening object, there's no way a tranquillizer would take effect in the two to three seconds it would take someone to seriously injure you.""[6]""

"The problem here is the classic slippery slope.  How much do you really want the state to be involved in judging whether someone is a fit parent?  For example:

* What about parents whose children take up smoking?  

* What about parents whose children fail a physical fitness test?

I think there should be efforts to educate these parents, but not prosecute them.  

Additionally, here are some other arguments:

1. Unlike actual abuse, there is generally no intent to harm or be neglectful here, which makes it hard to criminalize.

2. For children over a certain age, there is a certain amount of responsibility on their end.  Pets will eat what they are given, but children can and will exercise their own judgement.  An overweight 15 year old is far more responsible for his or her weight than their parents.

3. Does prosecuting otherwise good parents and taking away their children in these situations actually help the children?","I know I'm going to give a very mocked answer, but sometimes fat children aren't fat due to their parents. Despite their parents' best efforts, there are plenty of places where they can get unhealthy foods, especially once they get older.

"This is kind of an aside: 


I think both sides of this argument are missing the point here (and I do agree with points on both sides). While I do think that it is possible for automation to replace the lion's share of modern jobs (I just watched a lecture yesterday where it was claimed that only ~20% of factory jobs were lost overseas whereas they discovered in retrospect that almost ~80% were lost due to automation), I also think economists opposing this view have a good point when they say that we can create new jobs, ones that we can't even imagine today, to keep the majority of people employed to the same degree as today.


That said, I think there are two *very important* factors missing from this discussion: 


1) The inherent value of a newly created jobs compared to past jobs, and

2) Our economic system's ability to accommodate accelerating technological change in terms of employment


Regarding the first point, people tend to become disillusioned about work on a psychological level when they feel that their work isn't adding any value. That was one of Marx's core critiques about Capitalism when he argued how essential it was for the workers to control the means of production. The less valuable/necessary people percieve their jobs, regardless of how well compensated they are for it, the less satisfied they will be with their lives. I recently read an article about how the vast majority of people in cities like London, a place where many people (office drones) are employed in information industries doing jobs that didn't exist ten to fifteen years ago, feel that their jobs are utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things (and they're not wrong) and many subsequently feel depressed.


London is an extreme example but rest assured, with increasing automation, most other places will start to catch up. Information and information-based services will be (already is) the most important product that we produce, not physical goods/labour. This means is that the work we do as humans is becoming more work for the sake of work. A century ago, the majority of work that we did were things that quite obviously needed to be done. We repaired things, we built things, we provided crucial services, and so on. Think about ten people around you today and ask yourself: do the jobs they do create a net benefit for their lives and the lives of people around them, or are their jobs essentially bullshit?


You'd be surprised at how many jobs today add little to no value. Even if they do add some value, it's often not (nearly) enough to rationalize it taking up 40+ hours of someone's life each week. This trend is only going to get worse, too, as more and more ""critical"" jobs are automated/rendered obsolete and more and more bullshit jobs get added to the pool. It's no wonder that people are miserable: we've seen a kind of spiritual decay where the vast majority of people have become miserable in their employment and that it's only going to get worse until we decide enough is enough and no longer require people to work in order to provide for themselves. This is all exacerbated by the fact that we're collectively more educated and aware than we've ever been, and that we all know the most surefire way to become wealthy is to game the system (like on Wall Street), not create value for others.


As per the second point, say you disagree with my first point and want to argue that the value of new jobs being added to the economy is worthwhile enough to continue to employ the majority of people in new jobs. Fair enough. The other problem with this is that a lot of the jobs being added don't fit into the employment model of the past century. It's becoming harder and harder for companies to justify hiring people full time, putting them all in an office and making them sit in cubicles for 40+ hours per week. Just look at the business models of Uber, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram and so on: these companies are indicative of a 21st century employment model. They are not traditional vertically integrated companies that need to hire tens of thousands of people in order to function, instead they get by on hiring a handful of people and providing a service to more than a billion people. Traditional vertically integrated companies are learning from this as well and reducing the number of employees they have (when they can get away with it). 


Thanks to the internet and accelerating technological change, these 21st century business models are scalable in a way that traditional business models weren't. A lot of the information-based services and distribution models around them that needed to exist last century are totally irrelevant now and are in the middle of a mass extinction. That's why we've been hearing the death rattle from the MPAA and many other large ""information brokers"": they're irrelevant and they're flailing wildly trying to find a way to prop up the old business model just so they can survive (while making everyone hate them in the process). We don't need a middle man anymore, the software is the middle man with algorithms replacing humans as gatekeepers to 1s and 0s. 


So regardless of what you think about automation and job creation, you can't dodge the fact that our current employment models no longer make sense. The world is full of offices that exist for the sake of tradition (and supposed information security) where the majority of people sit at their desks doing valueless busy work and surfing the internet every chance they get. That's why we're seeing a huge boom in freelancing. A (regulated) Uber-style employment is likely going to be the new employment model for the next few decades. Companies are going to want to hire freelancers (from anywhere in the world), have them sign NDAs, produce X amount of work for them and those freelancers might do work for 2-3 companies at the same time.


Blue collar work is no exception. Companies like McDonalds are slowly and carefully revealing to the world that they intend to phase out many of their workers in the coming years, something I expect will be accelerated by minimum wage increases. Retailers, large and small, are beginning to becoming nothing more than glorified show rooms and many are losing the battle against online shopping. Jobs in the transportation industry (taxis, trucking etc) see the writing on the wall. ""Sharing economy"" services like AirBnB and Uber will continue to have an impact. Services like Instagram and smartphone cameras killed vertically integrated behemoths like Kodak. The list goes on.


Anyway, even if you think that automation is going to displace rather than replace people, I think you still need to concede that replacement is possible if we allow it, and that there are good arguments for replacement over creating jobs for the sake of creating jobs. First and foremost, unless we do something radical (like basic income) a lot of people (especially those not educated or business/tech savvy) are going to fall in the cracks opened up by accelerating change (like anyone who works in the transportation industry today). 

I also think there is another, even better argument for allowing ourselves to drop out of the labour market if we want to, and that argument is an environmental one: we overproduce and overconsume more than any other point in history, it is unsustainable and that we need to start producing and consuming less and therefore we need to start thinking up a new way to organize economic activity around the concept of sustainability.

**Late edit**: added tl;dr

**Tl;dr** 

- Basic human needs are finite and can be totally satisfied with automation in the foreseeable future
- Current levels of automation have already displaced humans away from work that has obvious value
- New jobs have increasingly less value than before when they are created in spaces where they can't be automated (yet) and thus job satisfaction is on the decline
- Many new jobs are created for the sake of creating jobs (a symptom of past bureaucracies / legislation / remaining inertia from 20th century employment practices)
- We increasingly overproduce and over consume because of our economic model and increased efficiency over time
- The employment system is shifting from full time to part time freelancing type employment, which can be inhumane without the proper framework in place (basic income) 
- We need to change our antiquated view of work where we think every able bodied person should work to one where we see work as optional and less centralized 
- We need to think of a new economic system or else things will start getting ugly and this is true regardless of whether you think future automation will displace or replace humans","I'm getting a PhD in this now.  Over the next 20 years things will get crazy.  To look over the horizon, there's a few technologies that are just now coming together.

 * Cheap Sensors: 6 years ago I wanted to make an RC Segway.  I started on it, but you either had to hand build a sensor from cheaper ones or buy one pre-made for $600.  Now, those sensors are $2 a piece and come in cell phones.

 * Computing Power: For things like automatic cars you need a lot of fast processing power because you can't wait 5 seconds to figure out if you're about to crash.  Right now, things are just getting to the level where a $500 or so computer can do enough calculations to have something workable.

Those 2 things will make a lot of people redundant.  It might be the biggest change society has ever experienced.  Robots building robots, driving everyone around and doing everything for us.  It'll change politics and how people view living life, but we'll have so much stuff it might be a lot better.

For the fear part, this changes war completely.  I think robotics is a WMD worse than atomic bombs.  Its hard to make atomic bombs, and countries can monitor each other, but anyone can download a program from the internet, load it into a robot, and turn it into an indiscriminate killing machine.

If you check out a video of a high powered quadcopter, then look at another of tricks people can make them do, the technology exists today for a small government or large group of people to make killing machines that could wipe out a city.  Right now, a country with a cell phone factory could convert it to make sniper drones by the thousands.  The only reason you we see it now is because governments like the US and China are more interested in technology that supports their troops in combat, which is more complex, instead of robotic ways to commit genocide.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed analysis of the current state of employment, the value of new jobs, and the changing nature of work due to automation.

"Literally no one is going to disagree that programs that give people jobs will be better at finding people jobs than programs which don't focus on finding people jobs. It's a tautology. The reason we have safety net programs is because we want the right people in the right jobs.

The types of jobs that publicize position vacancies to programs that focus on job placement are usually minimum wage and temp positions, bottom of the barrel type jobs where the employer isn't concerned so much with finding the right person for the position as a body to fill a hole.

If an accomplished accountant has a really unfortunate layoff when his company goes belly up, and can't find a comparable job for some time, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to give him a little cash to hold him over until he does find an equivalent position than to place him in meal assembly at Burger King where his skills will be completely wasted. 

Also, if safety net programs were defunded to provide for job placement and education programs, what would the really unfortunate people who don't have a cent to there name do to feed and house themselves and their families while attending daily classes or waiting for job placement?","There's a perception that you can live ""comfortably"" on welfare, which would naturally decrease someone's drive to work.  It's really not true.  The welfare state as it exists now makes it incredibly difficult to live a satisfying life without a source of income.

I'll give you an example.  Let's say you're a single person who is unable to work consistently because of a mental illness; not something that totally cripples you and makes you unable to leave the house every day, but something that causes you to suffer months-long bouts of depression or anxiety that make holding down a long-term job or building a career impossible.  Your resume is really bad because you've tried and failed to hold down a job for several years, which means it's hard for you to find work outside of a place like WalMart that will hire anyone with a pulse.

So, you apply for ""welfare.""  It varies a bit based on where you are, but what you can expect to get if you apply for the whole package is:  
- Food stamps, on the order of about $100 a month that can only be spent on unprepared food  
- Housing assistance, which means cheaper rent (not no rent) if you agree to live in a neighborhood where people get robbed and assaulted on a regular basis and everyone is selling drugs  
- Medical insurance, which will make your doctor's visits free but which will refuse to cover most non-generic prescriptions (remember, you're dealing with a mental illness that could kill you if you aren't medicated)  
- Cash assistance, which is exceedingly difficult to qualify for and can go as high as $200 in some states, but averages more like $85.  Usually these require that you're on SSI to get.  

You're disabled, so you can also apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, right?  Well, you can, but you'll get denied.  You have to pay a certain amount into Social Security to qualify for the disability insurance, and if you've been mentally ill since you were a teenager there's no way you've held down a job that long.  What you qualify for is SSI.  SSI tops out at roughly $750 a month, and they will reduce that dollar for dollar with any unearned income you get, like if, say, your parents are allowing you to live rent free or buying you the occasional fridge full of groceries.  If you do manage to temporarily find work, that amount will be reduced by fifty cents for every dollar you earn, after a couple of small deductions.

Add on to this that every single one of these programs is separate.  There is no monolithic ""welfare.""  These guys, and the food shelf, and any charity you work with will all want records and updates and details on your life.  If you do decide to make a try of un-fucking your life and get work, you will have to obtain and send out a half-dozen copies of your pay stubs to a half-dozen different offices, and a three-paycheck month or a single bonus check can devastate you.  These benefits take months to apply for, and if you lose them because you made too much money in one thirty-day period or saved up more than two grand (which can easily be wiped out by a single car repair bill) it can take as much as 90 days to get your benefits back.  During that time your already low income is cut.  You're eating one meal a day, you're letting your bills pile up, you're calling in favors and borrowing money from people who are already sick of you asking them for things.  Your friendships and family relationships get strained.  Your stepmother makes snide comments about how some people have to work for a living every time she sees you.  You get really stressed out and start having panic attacks, and lose your job because you're so stressed out from not eating.

Then the cycle starts all over again.

Nobody would ever choose to live like that.  You get no luxuries, you get no rest.  People who can't get out of the system aren't rejoicing because they get a free ride.  They're spending every day staring at people driving new cars, going out to eat and buying each other video game consoles for Christmas, and going crazy with envy.  They want that.

"The best arguments against polygamy aren't moral-there isn't anything morally wrong with multiple spouses if everyone agrees-they're practical. Marriage is a major status change that you choose to enter with another person. It means the law acknowledges who can visit you in the hospital, make decisions for you if you're sick, raise your kids if you die or make decisions for them if you're absent, who can share your bank account and affect your credit rating, and who gets half your stuff in divorce. Marriage is a major change in your rights and responsibilities towards specific other people. 

When you can only be married to one person at a time, both people have to consent to it. That changes with polygamy. I agree to marry my wife, but what if later she wants to also marry her boyfriend or girlfriend? Can this third partner make decisions for the children I had with my original wife? Does the third partner get part of the property my wife and I accumulated together if they divorce out? Does their debt affect my credit score? With polygamy, your rights and responsibilities towards specific people can change *without* your consent, if one spouse chooses to marry someone else. And what if the new spouse is also married?. You might end up with a lot of people you don't know/didn't choose having the ability to majorly impact your life.

Edit: I see that you respond to these kinds of arguments by suggesting people contract around it, but this isn't a workable solution for marriage. 1) Ideally, marriages last for the rest of your life. 50+ years. There is just no way to foresee and contract for every situation where you will have the opportunity to impact your spouses over that kind of time span. Marriage is fundamentally accepting the risk of future uncertainties with another person, of having to deal with the unforeseen together. That's why it's so important that people explicitly agree to the person they take that risk with. They can't effectively contract for all the unknowns and separate risks, and they might not want to be bound by the exact terms of an agreement they signed 20 years ago anyway. Love lives are not great places for contracts. 2) Even in the seemingly simple areas where you would think you can contract, you can't. Like with property, income doesn't stay separated once it comes in  to the household, and in divorce judges try to compensate people who sacrificed career opportunities in service of the family unit. There is no neat way to divide it into fractions or to give that paper fraction actual meaning out of your household property and bank account, and it will inevitably impact the spouse who did not marry the third spouse. Prenups between relatively simple two-spouse marriages are overturned, redrafted, or declared void all the time; the sense of predictability they offer is illusive, especially if you move states (every state has its own divorce laws). They wouldn't help much at all with polygamous marriages.

Things can go wrong with your spouse, but you consented to the risk by marrying them.
Things can go wrong with your children, but you accepted that risk by having and keeping children.
Things go wrong with your spouse's spouse, and you didn't have to sign up for it to ruin your credit or garnish your wages or otherwise massively impact your life. That's an issue, and it can't be easily solved by introducing more contracts into personal relationships.","""Wrong"" is a word that pertains to morality. So it's odd that you don't want a moral argument. 

But anyway:

* Is everybody equal in such a marriage? Does it vary depending on the time they've been married?
* Can new people be added?
* How is it structured? Is it 3 women married to a man, do they form a ring, or a mesh?
* Related to the above, how does divorce work? Can it fail due to disagreement?
* Is there a size limit? What if a whole town decides to get married, imagine the work untangling that will be.
* What if one person is in the hospital and there are two others that can make a life or death decision, and disagree?
* There are practical social issues. Eg, rich man gets himself 20 wives. Enough of that will skew the ratio in the community, resulting in some really pissed off people.
* Who do the children belong to?
* The court system will probably need an upgrade. We're talking about dramatically increasing complexity and opportunity for conflict.

I don't oppose the idea in principle, but the practical issues seem to be tough to solve, and I doubt they're about to get worked out tomorrow.

When you get more experienced you'll get better at reading signals and discussing such things, and with a woman who's into it you might not need to hold off as long before feeling comfortable partaking as when you first started with your sexual explorations.

"I feel the same way you do, re not being able to prove whether fetuses are ""persons"" who should have rights (another thread recently got completely derailed, tripping over itself, because of dancing around the words ""alive"" vs ""person,"" so let's not go there--obviously a fetus is a living thing made of cells, just like you, and bacteria--personhood is the question). 

It is sad and unfortunate that we cannot find out if fetuses are persons, that there is no real test. I'd like to know. But it's all in the definition. So my opinion on abortion came from asking ""For a moment, let's say they are persons. Let's even say zygotes are persons!"" From a pro-choice standpoint, this is the worst case scenario, yes? We'll grant the pro-life movement that every fertilized egg is in fact a full person, just like you and me.

Even then, I am pro-choice because I do not think we have a responsibility to other people that goes nearly that far. We do not require people to donate organs, or even blood (which has sooo much less consequence than pregnancy for a much shorter time). Not even to their own children. We do not require people to help others even if they are able. If you want to throw away your food and let someone starve, legally, you can. We may not LIKE this behavior. We may think it is rather awful, even. But we don't want to make it ILLEGAL, because we respect the rights of people to do what they want with their property. We ought to do at least as much for our bodies, which are literally US. 

Basically, I think that the question of personhood is actually not one we need to answer in this debate, because no person can hang out inside you, using your organs, causing you substantial discomfort and the potential of death, for 9 months. We wouldn't make anyone sign up for that to save anyone else, not even their child. So why would we do it in the case of pregnancy?

If your answer is ""they signed up for it cus sex,"" did you sign up for the car accident because you drove? What if you were going over the speed limit? Did you consent to all possible consequences of driving? Maybe, but we still try to save your life when you crash. We do this even for people who are engaging in quite dangerous behavior. Taking a risk (having sex, particularly in the case of having sex with protection) does not mean you signed up for the worst outcome. You know it may happen, but you aren't signing up for it any more than you are signing up for a car accident on your way to work.

We'll ignore the fact, for now, that in the case of rape no consent was ever given at all.

This is why I think abortion should be legal, even if I don't like it very much.","I honestly don't know anyone who is pro abortion. It's a sad and traumatic thing to choose to do, and I'm not sure it's something I would ever choose for myself. 

But not for one second do I think my choice not to have an abortion should affect someone's hard choice to have one.

When is it okay to limit a woman's right to do as she wishes with her own body? 

A women's right to control her reproductive organs should not end the moment someone sticks a penis inside her. 

It shouldn't end when he ejaculates, it shouldn't end just because she happens to be ovulating, or because an egg is inseminated. So when should her rights be limited with respect to her choice to abort the pregnancy? When should the rights of a fetus outweigh her right to choose her own destiny? 

Obviously by the time she gives birth, that fetus has full rights to life. But when did they start? Did the child's rights to life gradually come into being, or were they switched on suddenly?

I think that the fetus should only be deemed to have rights when it could theoretically survive even if the mother tragically died.  Only at this point do I see any point in supporting a fetus' rights. Before this it is too much a part of its mother to survive on its own and therefor too much a part of its mother to have rights separate from hers. 

So do I support abortion? No. Do I support it being legal? Absolutely! 

Also, I'm a man so who gives a shit what I think. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a strong argument by framing the abortion debate in terms of individual bodily autonomy and rights. The comparison to organ donation and the analogy of a person hanging out inside you using your organs effectively conveys the idea that no one should be forced to undergo such a significant physical burden against their will. This argument is compelling because it appeals to the fundamental right of individuals to make decisions about their own bodies, regardless of the personhood status of the fetus. Response 2 also addresses potential counterarguments, such as the idea that individuals ""sign up"" for pregnancy through sex, by drawing parallels to other risky behaviors that do not result in the loss of bodily autonomy. Overall, Response 2 presents a strong case for supporting legal abortion based on principles of bodily autonomy and individual rights.",0
"The problem is that people want to make the jobs of police officers impossible and that is what you are doing. This of it this way. If you were a police officer and they made your idea into law would you continue to be a police officer? Hell no. 

If police were held to the same laws as other citizens while they were working the job would actually be impossible and no sane person would sign up to do it. How would you suggest a police officer give a speeding ticket without speeding to catch the guy? It would be impossible. Now extend this to a police officer that is called for a possible armed robbery. How could the police officer defuse the situation and possibly save someones life if they were worried about getting arrested for murder?

I'm not saying there isn't a problem with police in this country but there is clearly also a problem with the way this countries citizens view the law. People view the law as suggestions and often ignore them. In so many of these high profile police cases the citizen is blatantly refusing to cooperate this the officer. This is an issue on both sides of the law there. There is mistrust for the government and usually the officer uses too much force or is racially biased. Both things need to change.

The most famous case of police misuse of force (Michael Brown) still really bugs me. People got up in arms because the officer didn't get put in prison for murder. The thing is there clearly wasn't enough evidence to convict that officer of murder. It was always obvious. That officer went on trial for murder and a bunch of people filed conflicting police reports on what happened so any eye witness account was put into question. The people that filed police reports when they didn't know what they were doing fucked up that case and might have got a guilty man set free. THE CIZITIZENS NEED TO CHANGE MORE THAN THE POLICE","The first thing you need to recognize is that a police officer isn't just another citizen. They have specialized training because their job puts them in a level of danger that other people don't face. The only comparable group is the military, and that justifies a special set of rules.

By highlighting the specialized training and the constant danger that officers are exposed to, it provides a strong argument for why they should be held to different standards than regular citizens.",0
"Two things... first if you want to move to NYC, you should know that NYC does not want you. You walk too slow, you talk too slow, you probably brought a car you can't park; much less drive. You're going to bitch and moan about prices, and eat at chain restaurants named after days of the week. 

To the folks in the city... you're just an asshole. Slow when you should be fast, fast when you should be slow, and always talking shit. 

You will notice on your drive into the city that the tolls are one way. This is so there is no barrier to you getting out. Seriously, there are 10 million people in the city at almost any time and only 8 million live there. 

NYC doesn't want you. NYC wants the people that live there to be invested in their neighborhood. Rent control does that because they know that they aren't getting kicked out because some whiter folks wanna move in. You know you can't find a less expensive place, so you look into ways you can improve or keep your neighborhood from turning into a cess pool. Barring an extreme event like the introduction of an extremely inexpensive, powerful, highly addictive drug this helps. (Although I accept that a case can be made that the permanence also encourages gangs based on territory... but tbh those happen everywhere.) 

""White flight"" was not as big of an issue for NYC as it was for other cities in part because of rent control.

Rent control is also going to phase out on its own as those living in rent controlled apartments age and pass away. 

Rent stabilization on the other hand is a statewide thing. It's also needed statewide. Although each municipality gets to decide if it's needed in that particular city.  First reason I can think of to answer the question of ""why is it needed?"" is the SUNY system. While most states have two or three cities for their state colleges... NY has over 60. For comparison UC has only 9. There are more people in California than there are in NY. For landlords of a less than honest and forthright disposition college students are low hanging fruit. Rent increases for sub-standard multi-unit housing because they know parents or loans are going to pay the rent, and the students don't know better. They're just happy they found a place for themselves and their 3 best friends they won't be able to stand at the end of the year. Rent control/stabilization helps to prevent these abuses. If the educated college students have issues with understanding their rights imagine how screwed poor less educated people are. 


Yeah... So point one in a nutshell is that the city doesn't want you, but is willing to invest in the people that already call it home. 

Break for Specific ideas:

&gt; * Current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant. If the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates. Currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely. 

So Guy gets an apartment, signs the lease (original tenant) gets married and dies in a horrible accident.. now his widow not only has to deal with her husbands death, but her rent goes up too because she wasn't an ""original tenant""? Damn, that's just cold. 

This is the scenario that legacy rent control protects. Yes a kid might move back into their parents apartment, but generally they will have their own lives and careers by the time their parents pass away/ vacate the apartment. By keeping legacy controls vague and open, we allow for some abuse (in the opinions of some) but the cost of that abuse is still less than the cost of elimination of the benefit, and the confusion/expense created by trying to create/enforce caveats for every special situation. 

&gt; * Newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls.

In terms of specific ""rent control""... this has been the situation for forty some odd years. Stabilization continues, but exempting new construction would encourage the destruction/reconstruction or re-habbing of existing housing in order to create New/newly rented units. Ex 10 story rent controlled/stabilized building with 200 tenants is razed to build a 15 story building that houses 300... The original 200 now need to find another home and won't be able to afford to move back into the apartment that now occupies the same space as their old home.

&gt; * Rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5% per year.

Confused here as currently can't landlords petition for a change of up to 7.5% for a year? And at 5% a year.. in ten years time there will be a ~50% discrepancy between the increase in rent and inflation (using a ballpark average recent rate of 2% per year)

&gt; * Rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market. This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land.

Housing projects, while well-intentioned, have a serious history of segregation and exacerbating the effects of criminal activity on a community. While rent-control works by putting people from different socio-economic backgrounds in close proximity, public houses homogenizes the socio-economic backgrounds of the people living there. This is NOT a good thing for our society. A ghetto (in the classical definition not the ""black neighborhood"" definition) is essentially a combination of /r spacedicks and /r circlejerk. The worst aspects of the community have a very high short term reward at the expense of long term growth and the community in general. 

&gt; * Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis.

Subsidies with conditions need to have the conditions met to continue, although allowing negotiations for a subsidy to turn into a loan existing is not a bad idea as situations change and being able to respond to that change is crucial.

The rental rights in NY and NYC specifically were created because of abuses by landlords. The ""property rights"" of a tenant were established to protect against those abuses. Todays landlords aren't more moral and caring than their 19th/10th century counterparts, and eliminating those rights will again normalize those abuses. 

Point 2: 

Without some form of rent control or stabilization rents would initially increase (and drastically) however the people who make the city actually run would be forced out of their homes. There would be a lag time because evictions take time, but suddenly there wouldn't be anybody to do the jobs that need doing in the city. Without basic things like the subway, trash collection, waiters at restaurants, actors performing in off-Broadway shows.. the bubble created by the elimination of controls/stabilization would pop. This would crash the market leaving the speculative landlords who were so eager to see controls removed holding worthless property. 

While it's possible that the people would just move back... it's doubtful. Look at Detroit. That is what happens to a city when it's primary draw/ industry is destroyed. NYC needs its artists and the working class that generates good artists. Those people need someplace to live that they can afford. 

Nobody wants to go to NYC to look at a stock broker or accountant. Sorry to all those stockbrokers out there. You might be nice, but you're not interesting to watch. A broadway show.. even the cheesy trite pieces like ""Cats"" are entertaining. 

What would America have in terms of art without NYC? 

Mark Twain, gospel, folk, country, and bluegrass. That's pretty much it. Ok... Chicago might have a claim on popularizing/ spreading the blues beyond the Mississippi flood plains, but it's hotly contested by NYC.

Jazz would have languished in New Orleans if it weren't for the Cotton Clubs and radio broadcasts out of NY. Punk as an idea was around for a bit, but NYC and CBGB's specifically were its physical and spiritual home.  But without the content from NY, Hollywood would have had nothing to film until the mid 70's. No Lenny Bruce, no George Carlin, no late night TV to speak of although Carson was a west coast guy the gig originated in the east. Rock and Roll didn't have a meaningful home until Alan Freed hit NYC.

Without NYC's unique combination of blue collar and upper upper white collar experiences most of the art and entertainment we know and take for granted today wouldn't exist. That isn't an exaggeration, if anything it's an understatement. Yes, Atlanta, Seattle, St. Louis, San Francisco and other cities have had some major influences in specific time periods, but we keep coming back to NYC. 

Why? Because more than any other city in the country the rich and poor live side by side. Taking the same trains, complaining about the same weather, sharing the same barstools. Because rent control and stabilization are inefficient, sloppy, and have all of what you perceive to be negative effects. 

So while there might be some short term benefits to the pockets of certain landlords... the long term effects will decimate the city at worst, make it bland and irrelevant at best. 
","There's a decent arguement to be made -- and it's ably made here and several other places -- that rent laws do indeed restrict the supply of housing stock, and artificially drive up rents, as landlords just find ways to recover costs by other means. The major problem I have with decontrolling as a remedy is that (1) it will make for a painful transition period, and (2) the decontrol argument, that rents will stabilize on their own once regulation is lifted, makes theoretical sense but might not bear out in the real world. In other words, while theoretically sound, the real-world ramifications are short-term pain for long-term.... something. 

So, my first push-back to you is, has this been tried elsewhere? What happened in those cities? Or, how have rents fared in cities without rent regulation? Basically: is there any *empirical* basis for decontrolling? 

Second, I assume your end-goal is to increase the available housing supply, and by doing so, drive down rents or at least check the rate of rising rents. If so, there are other more politically palatable means to the same end. Chief among them, [real property tax reform](http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/05/why-billionaires-dont-pay-property-taxes-in-new-york/389886/?utm_source=nymagFB). Today, owners of rental buildings pay disproportionately higher taxes than owners of condominiums. Naturally, rental building owners pass those taxes onto their tenants. By reshuffling the tax structure to invert that disparity, the cost of running the city could be made to fall _at least equally_ on owners of pied-a-terre's. Theoretically, owners would pass their own tax savings on to their tenants in the form of reduced rents. 

Interestingly, rent regulation, even in the city, is a _state_ issue. The state, which leans conservative, is more likely to repeal the rent laws than the more progressive city. But state legislators would face _intense_ backlash from downstate representatives. It would arguably empower De Blasio, too, who has otherwise been flagging, since he would look like the savior of the City against Albany's out-of-touch, careless conservatism. (I'm not saying I believe this, I'm saying it's how it would be sold.) The last thing Albany wants to do -- the _very_ last thing Cuomo wants to do -- is make De Blasio look reasonable. 

By contrast, city property taxes are a _city_ issue; unlike De Blasio's ""millionaire tax,"" he wouldn't need Albany approval to cut taxes for rental property owners (and by extension the middle class) and raise taxes on luxury condo owners (the upper class). But Albany could seize the chance to continue characterizing him, however unfairly (in this case), as an un-serious politician and class warrior.

What could be done to moot this nascent political conflict is, accomplish both plans separately, but by agreement, as a package deal that exposes neither side to political backlash. Albany, placated by the phased repeal of rent reofrm and, could forgive De Blasio his tax restructuring and promise not to fight back against it. De Blasio and city politicos, placated by tax restructuring, could forgive Albany and promise not to fight back against rent increases. In other words: while abolishing rent regulation might never happen on its own, it might happen, and be more effective, passed together with tax reform. This is not so much to change your view on the _intellectual merit_ of letting rent protection lapse, but rather, to change your view on that as a panacea. 

[edited last paragraph for clarity/sentence structure issues]",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more structured and logical argument against rent control, focusing on the potential real-world consequences and proposing an alternative solution through tax reform. The response also addresses the political implications and suggests a compromise that could benefit both sides. This approach is more persuasive as it offers a practical and feasible alternative to rent control, backed by empirical evidence and political considerations.",0
"Shrinking populations are actually really disruptive and dangerous things.  There are many reasons for this but it all basically boils down to less economic activity is bad.

First lets consider the direct effects.  Property prices would plunge.  If there are 100 houses and 100 families to fill them you need to build a new house to accommodate the 101st family.  The material supplies, land value, and profit margin set the cost of that house.  The value of the land is based on what the last piece of land in the area sold for.  This is a nice stable system and allows every one of the 100 families who already owns a house to have a house worth hundreds of thousands of dollars (as thats what a new house costs).  If however you have 99 families and 100 houses that 100th house is worthless.  No one wants it, so no one buys it, no one uses it, AND more importantly, if that house is worth $0.00 all of the other houses are worth $0.00 as well.  We instantly destroyed the entire community's home values.  Detroit has a shrinking population and you can buy houses there for less than a cheese burger.

Next the stock market.  Stock prices are based, to a large degree, on anticipated future growth of the companies.  Publicly traded companies tend to sell for 12X their annual earnings.  Privately traded companies tend to sell for 7X their annual earnings.  This is because of the difference in growth prospects.  With a declining population and thus declining business activity the stock market would take a huge hit wiping out huge amounts of savings (from people who already lost all the equity in their homes).

Next comes government debts.  Right now government services in all of the western world are financed by deficit spending.  Lenders lend money because they feel the country will be able to pay it back eventually.  If however the GDP starts to go down investors won't lend and governments will fall into the trap that snared Greece.

I could go on and on and on.  But population decline is really bad news.","I'm an evolutionary ecologist by profession and I can provide a little perspective here that may change your view.   
   
If you happen to be a person attempting to change OP's view that is.   
    
Population growth is one of those things that's pretty well understood. There are a few ways for populations to change in numbers and the most basic is exponential growth. That's how human population is changing.   
But, when that's how populations change, they will hit what OP called a 'growth cap'. We call this 'carrying capacity' and mathematically it's represented as K.   
           
What follows here will potentially get a little farther than necessary into  the ecology of the issue, but I think it's necessary to fully explain the situation our species faces in the next few hundred years.    

_________________    
     
        
Carrying capacity and population growth (r/K selection):     

Check out Fig. 5 in [this link](http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/an-introduction-to-population-growth-84225544)    
    
On that graph there is a place on the x-axis marked K.   
   
That graph is a line that represents how a population would grow under normal conditions. Meaning that it isn't growing exponentially, it's growing logistically.    
K is the carrying capacity of the habitat. It's the number of individuals of a species that can be supported by the habitat.   
   
K-selected animals would have a population around K. They have stable populations and relatively low mortality and will generally hover right around where they should be.     
     
They are called K-selected because they are selected for populations right around the carrying capacity.    
     
r-selected species are 'rate-selected'. So they are selected to be growing at a maximal rate. That's because they are usually something like mice that will have huge mortality, so the individuals are all pumping out as many offspring as possible.     
    
r-selected organisms will generally have a population right around K/2. That's because that's where the slope of that line is steepest, so that's where it's growing fastest.      
     
(Edit: To clarify, each species would have a different graph. So the mouse would have a different graph from the cat. The mouse population would be at K/2 for the mice, not K/2 for the cats.)
     
**Now check out Fig 8.**   
That's human population since the advent of agriculture. Notice it's not a logistic growth curve. Our population is growing exponentially. That's because we're K-selected, but we haven't reached K yet.     
When we reach K what's going to happen is that we'll exceed it. When a population is growing like ours it will exceed K, then there will be famine, disease, death, real apocalyptic shit. That will drop the population well below K. The population will then start to rebound and go towards K again. The it will exceed it again and fall again. But this time the rise above K will be smaller and when it falls again it won't fall as far below K. It will sort-of oscillate about K for a while then level out and hover around K.     
     
Problem with human population growth is that we are destroying all of the habitat that would define K. So we're not just exponentially going for K, we're also dragging K towards us. And in the end, when we reach K, we may well have lowered that bar far further than 7 billion.

"&gt; everyone is entitled to human companionship

Why? Everyone should have it and society should endeavour to provide it but by what laws of nature are people *entitled* to it?

Further, what if by claiming entitlement you’re taking away someone else’s freedom? You’re entitled to not want to be someone’s companion. Now that is a real entitlement.

&gt; Single guys suffering deserve as much respect and empathy as women who may face different challenges

"Hi.
Congratulations on getting into, and being able to go to college. I hope it's a fabulous experience for you.

&gt;But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating.

It would be a very scary situation.  As would hundreds of other situations that might occur.  The constant in all those situations would be you.   Remember, fears are internal things.  Therefore, should be dealt with internally.  That is, instead of worrying about what a partner might potentially do, make sure you are confident in what you do. 

Nothing wrong with telling a partner(s) that you have this concern too.  Discuss it with them.  Your feelings are valid, your concern exists.  How your partner(s) react to this disclosure might help you decide if they are a good choice.  Might sooth your fears.  There is a lot of power in communication. 

&gt; I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent

Knowing it's an issue of consent is no small thing.  Get familiar with the language, and comfortable using it when applicable.  Use more communication instead of less.  Don't assume your partners know much about consent, actually have the talks.  

Whether you want a plethora of sexual partners or a single monogamous honey, you can learn by and teach each other better communication (not just about consent) which will directly reduce the possibility of any ... misunderstandings, or hook ups with unstable people.  

Also, I want to point out that you are not immune to sexual assault because you are a young man.  Read the stats below with the understanding that some of those (90% +) unreported assault victims are men.  

As you make friends, and lovers, have each others backs.  Learn how to keep each other safe and do so.  Don't settle for hook-ups with people you don't trust, or friends who don't respect you or others.  Make friends with both genders and have everyone's back.  Don't fall into that us vs. them fear baiting malarkey. You're stepping off into your future. Make it, and the relationships in it as positive and unlikely to have issues as possible.

I think the AV Club nails it this week as to why this scene was not okay [link](http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/game-thrones-newbies-unbowed-unbent-unbroken-219566):

&gt;**Game Of Thrones has whiffed with this type of development in the past [rape], failing to treat an established reality within its universe with the proper amount of gravity. In the episode’s one majorly sour note, “Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken,” swings too far in the opposite direction**, as the ominous score, the characters’ reactions, and the involvement of Ramsay all scream “Game Of Thrones does not endorse sexual assault!” **Here’s an example in which bluntness was the incorrect tactic, deployed largely to demonstrate to Sansa what a horrible dude she’s married. Whether or not this was a complete misstep will depend on whether or not the rape has repercussions on anything deeper than a story level—something that, as Myles points out in the experts review, Game Of Thrones isn’t equipped to handle**, on account of how many characters and stories are being dealt with each episode. I’d like to think the people who make the show have learned from past mistakes with Daenerys and Cersei, but I could just be lying to myself.

Also, in the comment sections on the AV Club article, a user named Alien Jesus made two great points:

&gt;**Worse, in this case it did not bring anything new in defining an already repellent character, it merely exists, gratuitous, leaving a horrible taste in the mouths of your fanbase.** 

&gt;**It also transcends merely poor choice, it’s borders on the obscene.**

I mean, there's really not a way to depict rape that isn't obscene, but honestly I thought they were going to fade out of that scene about 1 minute or so before they did - and that last minute has pure horror. It was unnecessary on both counts: no added character development or plot point, and went on for too long and was too graphic and horrifying. They could have just alluded to the fact by cutting out a minute or two earlier and it wouldn't have been as bad. 

Both the scene and the rape itself didn't *have* to happen. And it was depicted so horrifyingly. 

You state that you think murder is worse than rape, but while the end result is worse because it's final, I think the experience of being raped or tortured (rape IS torture) is worse than experience of being murdered. The torture of Theon, the flaying scenes, the sexual violence, and the emotional torture are the most horrifying parts of the show for me, perhaps equally. But they were all in the books. This was the first time one of our main characters got tortured when she wasn't in the books, so that's why people are taking to the internet saying it shouldn't have happened.  ","I going to copy and paste a post from another subreddit and mayve can give you some insight on it. Credit goes to /u/46n2arejustaheadofme

&gt; There's a big difference between talking about how it was an intense and unpleasant scene (it was supposed to be), and generating outrage because that person personally doesn't find the scene morally acceptable or doesn't like that Sansa is continually victimized and politicizes it. The latter is SJW territory. The former is fair game and a source of great discussion like any other intense scene.

&gt; It would be useful to understand that difference.

&gt; The first is expressing a valid opinion, the second is pointlessly conflating depicting an immoral act with condoning it. Criticizing the writers for depicting rape is probably one of the stupidest things someone can do for a TV show, if you don't like it don't watch it.
Personally I thought this scene was right on track for the show and was realistic given her circumstances. It wasn't any more graphic or unpleasant than other scenes, and it didn't really affect me deeply. I mean what were they expecting to happen? Sansa is building up to her revenge, but we're not there yet. She, Brienne, and Theon all need to get twisted into the plot a bit more before any revenge can happen. 

&gt; There are some huge parallels with Dany's storyline, we'll have to wait and see how she reacts.
All these people saying ""it doesn't follow her character development"" aren't looking at it clearly. They just sympathize with the character and when something bad happens to her they throw a hissy fit. They create a reason to conflate something they didn't want to happen with poor writing, even though this is actually one of the best written scenes in the show. Likewise Theon's torture at the hands of Ramsay was also well written.

&gt; Again, there's a difference between finding a scene unpleasant, and literally thinking the existence of the scene is objectionable because it depicts the rape of a character you like, and turning it into something political.
We can have the discussion about the scene being intense and unpleasant without bringing politics into it. The whole ""rape is a bigger problem than murder"" trope is leading me to believe that you might fall a bit into both categories. Rape and murder could be nonexistent and people would still be affected differently by depictions of each in the show.
The scene was intense, it was meant to be, it was realistic given the circumstances, and ""if you still think there's going to be a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""

&gt; Scenes are going to affect people differently, and opinions are fine, but we don't have to go very far too find actual batshit crazy SJWs and rabble rousers who are just generating outrage so they can feel special.

&gt; It's a TV show for seven's sake.

&gt; Edited pronouns for clarity",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more nuanced and critical analysis of the scene in question, pointing out specific reasons why it was unnecessary, gratuitous, and poorly executed. The references to past mistakes in handling sensitive topics in the show and the comparison between murder and rape add depth to the argument against the scene. This response also includes insights from other sources and users, adding credibility to the argument.",0
"The issue with taxes are the impact it has on the person you're taxing. Firstly, a 15% flat tax would be a significant decrease in tax revenues, so that's unrealistically low.

The issue with taxes is what activity are the people you're taxing giving up to pay for the taxes. The more someone earns, the more likely that paying taxes is only cutting into luxury expenses. Currently, the bottom 20% of earners pay a total tax rate of about 8%, so you're essentially doubling the taxes on poor people. This is taking money out of budgets for food, housing, and basic expenses. When you're making $20k per year, losing another 8% of your income to taxes is devastating. If you're making $500k per year, a tax cut means you maybe take extra nice vacations or buy the biggest Mercedes instead of the 2nd biggest. Additionally, spending on basic stuff is most beneficial to the economy. Tax cuts for lower income people generate more economic activity than tax cuts for wealthy people. Any time you're generating economic growth, you're also growing future tax revenues, so cutting taxes for poor people ultimately allows you to lower the overall tax burden.

Taxing lower income people has a much larger effect on children. Lowering a families ability to invest in essential things for their kids leads to lower educational achievement, higher rates of behavioral problems and crime, etc. These all have a steep economic cost down the road.

&gt;It seems to me that it is punishing somebody for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class.

There is no point in our tax system where making more money results in you taking less home. The top marginal rate is less than 40%. You get to keep a bit less of that extra dollar, but you always have more to spend when you make more money. Additionally, consider that after a certain income all your basic expenses are met, and any additional money you make is 100% disposable. 

&gt;but would still be encouraged to leave their capital in the US economy instead of finding ways around the tax code

Investments are taxed as capital gains, which are flat as you have described. A flat tax does nothing to discourage seeking ways around taxes. If you have $100 k, and the tax is 15%, as long as you can avoid the tax for less than $15k, you're going to do it because at the end of the day you end up with more money.","&gt; making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class

How so? If I make 100k, I end up paying about 18% taxes. If I make 200k, I end up paying around 23% in taxes. But when all is said and done, my take home pay still increases by a considerable margin. So of course I still would rather make 200k than 100k.

And salaries are certainly not proportional to effort or hard work or whatever virtuous qualities one might invoke to say that the higher income folks ""deserved"" it. When my wife was a teacher, I made about 4 times her salary. Our educations were comparable in terms of cost. She worked at least as hard as I did. Maybe you want to say  I deserve it because I'm just super smart / genetically gifted, but would you say that I'm ""4 times as smart as she is""? What the heck would that even mean? The best you can say is that that I ""deserve it"" more because I happened to choose a degree that was in higher demand, because that's what it ultimately comes down to. But does that make me ""deserve"" 4 times more money? I don't think so. Salaries are what they are for many economic reasons. But they have little to do with fairness. And a flat tax is only as fair as the original income distribution.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the impact of taxes on different income brackets, highlighting the disproportionate burden on lower-income individuals and families. It also addresses the misconception that making more money results in taking home less, which is a common argument against progressive taxation. Response 2 also explains how tax cuts for lower-income individuals can lead to more economic growth and ultimately lower the overall tax burden.",0
"The [chance of a random American being killed](http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2009/09/madds_bad_with_the_facts.html) by a drunk driver is about one in 100k in any give year.

But the chance of *ME* being killed by a drunk driver is vastly smaller.  I'm almost never driving after 10pm, don't drive much on rural roads, and most of my driving is on low-speed surface streets.

Statistics are great  for getting overall trends, but suck at predicting individual outcomes.

If I lived alone (i.e., no spouse or family), were well-trained in handling firearms safely, with no history of depression, the odds would be dramatically different than the ones you list.

There just aren't a whole lot of circumstances that make it likely that my gun would be used in error.

You point may hold that it's irrational *for the average person* to own a gun.  But for many real people it's completely rational.","I think there are more exceptions to that rule than you care to admit.

If you've ever lived in the country, you know how valuable a gun can be. It is not uncommon for people to wander up your driveway and check to see if anyone is inside the house. More than once, I've been saved from robbery (or worse) by brandishing a rifle. But the best part is I've never had to shoot anyone. I've never even had to shoot *at* anyone. For most purposes, just the sight of a gun is enough.

So I'd argue that it is very rational to keep a gun in your house for self-defense purposes. However, it could be considered irrational (considering the statistics you mentioned) to keep ammunition.",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a personal anecdote that directly relates to the OP's concerns about self-defense.

"Chopsticks are more versatile in a family style environment where you don't want to touch every piece of food with your utensil when you go to pick something up.

"The amount of social services and socialism is much more strongly equated with the wealth of a country than with its diversity. An ethnically diverse state such as Belgium is much more socialist than Bangladesh, which is 98.5% ethnically Bengali. The Nordic countries are socialist because they are rich. 

Immigrants do not prevent socialism either. Just look as how Canada is far more socialist the the USA despite the fact that it has a much larger amount of immigrants. Burundi, which receives almost no immigrants, is very non-socialist.

The rise of right-wing parties is essentially the rise of a scapegoating philosophy which blames the country's woes on immigrants. However, in times of economic depravity there will almost always be a scapegoat of some sort. People do not like the idea that everyone is personally, equally responsible for bad economic times, or that it is just random. Sometimes that scapegoat will be the rich, other times it will be immigrants, or corporations, or the government. 

The reason immigrants are selected as the scapegoat is multifaceted. 

1. They are unable to vote, making them an easy target for politicians
2. They are less relatable because of their cultural differences
3. They have an advantage in that they are more economically efficient (work for less pay, work harder).

The point I am trying to make is that societies can be diverse without being hateful, and that immigrants are unjustly blamed for economic woes which are not their fault. ","&gt;I can only see socialistic systems (The harder variety that imposes 90% tax rates and such) work out in ethnically, culturally homogenous societies like the Nordic states, or certain Orthodox Jewish sects. 

Id agree but that's a pretty specfic type of socialism. Also it depends on the time period and that state of the nation or federation. As an American who isnt a socialist country 90% tax rates pulled us out of our great depression. High taxes helped us after WWII I believe as well. In history high tax systems can work, you could argue in difficult economic circumstances only. 

&gt;My hypothesis is that extreme racial/cultural difference (Skin Color, Mutually Exclusive Religion, Colonial Grievances, etc.) between populations leads to self-segregation, behind-the-back othering/scapegoating, and lower interpersonal trust on average

Well your society and any society with heavy diversity will definitely face varying levels of these problems no matter what type of institutions are used. Humans naturally like to put things in mental categories, so with all forms of diversity someone is facing unequal adversity at somepoint.

&gt;- the foundation for a socialistic society where all are to be treated equally. You might be willing to do business with the other group, but god forbid your family invite them over or get intimate with them. As long as visibly different groups with past antagonisms exist, people will judge members of the other group differently, at least with no other information available. 

Democracy, Communism, Socialism, and a Republic all promote unity and equality amomg the masses on paper. As of so far it has been impossible to literally replicate a perfect form of any of these. They are all amended specifically to a country or region that doesn't cause war or they are fighting to change the foundations.

&gt;I suspect the primary reason right-wing parties against the EU and Social Democracy are on the rise, is due to lower interpersonal trust brought on by 1.) The Continuing Employment Slump and 2.) Immigration, particularly from Africa and the Muslim world. 

Well when taking the public opinion during bad times will always get a bad rating, with people questioning the current system more often. Just as the opposite would occur during good times, socially or 
economically.

&gt;the economy continues to slug along in the midst of austerity, the natives are feeling a tad powerless, with the lower classes having to compete now with immigrant labor - leading to scapegoating and resentment.

This is the same way the public felt in America around our last major depression. Statistically deeper the recession or depression the greater levels of prosperity and recovery follow in the last century or so at least.

&gt; This is not a new phenomenon - the entire history of the industrial age is replete with labor-fueled resentment from the lower-class establishment toward foreigners trying to take their place. 

Your counter arguement is the main point, this is not a new phenomenon and its not a non common one. It also certainly is not specfic to any one form of government, or party, or even social group. Even American politics are starting to open up to socialism and we seem to be dropping the negative meaning more.

&gt;Please change my view. I'm open to your ideas.

"I am going to start with the caveat that I am not trying to change your overall opinion. I am ONLY trying change your opinion on this particular segment of your reasoning: ""...this was wrong to do, *because he has fought for civil rights before and his economic platform greatly fights for the poor and working class, in which black people are disproportionately represented*."" I totally agree that Bernie Sanders has one of the better records on civil rights among the candidates who are running. However, that makes him a better target, not a worse one. It would be completely pointless to show up at a Donald Trump rally and say something about Black Lives Matter (or any racial issue). Donald Trump is a clear and overt racist. There is nothing that can be done to make Donald Trump a good candidate on race. Bernie Sanders is a relatively good candidate on race, but many people who have race as the primary political issue that they care about believe that he could be better. By targeting Sanders, who is already a relatively good candidate on race, people can put pressure on him to make race a primary element of his campaign and to refine his opinions on policies regarding racism and social justice. 

I don't know what the motivations of these women necessarily were (their message was VERY muddied by a lot of factors) and I don't think their actions were appropriate or helpful at this time. But I think the idea that Bernie Sanders should be free of criticism on racial issues specifically because he has a decent history on them is silly. If people who are not satisfied with his record at this time criticize him and he steps up to the plate, they might have a candidate they actually want to vote for.","I got lunch today with a group of friends who range from liberals focused issues facing the black community to more radical Black liberation politics. They saw the issue as a matter of access, it was an easy soap box to stand on. You have to understand among some strongly liberal black activists there is a deep mistrust of white led Progressivism. 

The example that Bernie Sanders voted to extradite Assata Shakur was brought up a lot as an example of a progressive politician using civil rights when it's convenient but avoiding more controversial issues that many Black activist see as important. That even when ""meeting half way"" on controversial issues, ""half way"" is  only defined by the White parties. That in the long run even progressive politicians with a good civil rights record still need to be put under pressure so Black Progressive Activism isn't swept to the side.

"These are good rules of thumb for ""civil behaviour"" i.e. an etiquette, a how-to-act when in society, but they are not at the core or morality. How we treat each others is a secondary concern/consequence - how we treat ourselves is primary - it has existential primacy, which means it is more fundamental. (This primacy of how we treat ourselves is implied by the gold and silver rules, but not the platinum). 

The core of morality is that the individual has the capacity to choose, and all choices have different consequences that one choice is better and of greater value than another. To deliberately choose a greater value over the lesser is the core of morality, and to choose the bad over the good is the core of immorality.

The Gold and Silver rules are only as good as this more fundamental aspect of morality, how you treat yourself. Even Robinson Crusoe, alone on an island, has choices to make that make him either a virtuous man who works hard and struggles to do the right things to survive, or an immoral man who ignores his circumstances and chooses to laze on the beach wishing vainly for the coconuts to fall.

There are thousands of virtues (and vices) that have nothing to do with others, but that require a sustained effort of moral/righteous choices to attain *such as*: self-honesty, integrity, clarity of mind, industry, productiveness, rationality, creativity, focus/concentration, imagination, pride, courage, determination, knowing when to reward/punish yourself, knowing when to push on or rest etc etc!

The Golden and Silver rules are only as useful to society as the virtues you have yourself! (The platinum sounds like a nightmare of second-guessing other people's thoughts...I'm a bit iffy on that one).","The Golden rule is obviously deeply flawed, because people want very different things.  The Platinum rule gets around this, but there are more than a few problems with it.

1. Uncertainty.  It is often hard to know what others want.  It's a nice idea to treat others they want to be treated, but in practice that's hard to do.

2. What a person wants may require you doing an immoral act.  If a heroin addict wants you to give them heroin, does that mean it is moral to do so?

3. Conflict.  Often the wants of one person may be in conflict with another.  A person may not want to be put in prison, but if they are killing people, it is moral to put them there for the protection of others. How does this help you decide between mutually oppositional desires?

I know this seems biased like I am arguing that Spanish should be the international language and it's my native language, but it makes more sense if it were.

You are.  Because it's your mother tongue, you're minimizing the particular difficulties it has, while highlighting the difficulties of other languages.  

In truth, very very few people are in a position to trust their feelings as to how 'easy' a language is.  

&gt;English is rising only because it's commonly being taught as a second language, if you change the language it will also rise.

You're sort of minimizing this part as well.  It isn't as though there's an official ruling board that's selected English, and all you need to do is change that committee's mind and everything will start working out.  

It's more of an organic, self-reinforcing system, one that includes lots of choices besides trade agreements;  American (and to some extent, British) movies, television, and music simply command more presence on the world stage.  While it is true that I've seen a fair amount of foreign (subtitled) movies that got distributed to theaters here in America, it isn't anywhere near parity with the number of American movies that get widespread global distribution.  

Because so many other people have already learned English as a second language, there's more value in additional people learning English as their second language.  In terms of communicating with people you're likely to be in a position to want to communicate with, English has a lot in its favor.

There is certainly a case to be made that there are better choices if everyone agreed to ignore those factors.  See Esperanto.  But those other factors are a large way to explaining why Esperanto hasn't really been successful, and I'm not sure Spanish is leaps and bounds better in those regards.  

&gt;Also the whole small scale system that English has does not even make sense like why a billion is a thousand of a million where in long scale it's a million of a million.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.

","The growth of a language as an international language is an organic thing, not something socially engineered by a board or anything. I am a native English speaker, and I agree that it is not the best language for international business use, but it is not something we can just change.

Batman has more options than just killing the Joker. He could, for instance, kick him in the spine and leave him a paraplegic. Or amputate his limbs.

There is a wide gulf of stuff Batman could do between ""kill joker"" and ""leave Joker to the authorities"".

I don't agree. 

&gt; If you are against capitol punishment or killing in general, we obviously have an unbridgeable gap here, and cannot possible come to an agreement

Batman is against this. He is against the killing people and thus he doesn't do it. This belief comes from when his parents were killed.  
You could say that you have an unbridgeable gap between your view and Batman's. 

But Batman has no obligation in whatever way to kill the Joker. He doesn't even have the right to do what he does as a vigilante and he certainly doesn't have a license to kill. Demanding or allowing this would lead to Batman become a precedence for making self-justice acceptable.

He doesn't. If he did then everybody else would bare responsibility. He does not have an obligation to do what he does so there is no way for him to have responsibility or for him to be blamed.

A much bigger point (and you said you know this) is that if Batman were to kill he'd basically become something similarly twisted to the Joker.

(Ever since the Supreme Court case *Society of Sisters* in 1925)  Sure, there are exemptions such as private tutoring or private school, but these are not feasible for all people.  Without any doubt, there are people who, due to circumstance, can only attend public school and are mandated to do so by Federal law. 

Now, courts have certainly tried to balance the liberty of the parents/student and the greater good in cases regarding education.  One Constitutional issue that gets particular scrutiny is that relating to religion in First Amendment.  First, there is the establishment clause, which basically says government cannot establish any sort of religion.  Second, there is the free exercise clause which basically says government cannot prevent persons from freely practicing their religion. 

Now, we look at the issue at hand.  Some religions expressly prohibit vaccination, and forcing them to get a vaccination would almost certainly been seen as a violation of the free exercise clause.  

Therefore, I wish to change your view on just this point:  Medical AND Religious exemptions must be considered, or else this idea (similar to Jerry Brown's new law in California) will be struck down by courts on First Amendment grounds.  ","As much as I hate defending the anti-vaccine crowd, I think the problem with mandatory vaccination for public school is that school is also compulsory. Ever since No Child Left Behind, education has been mandatory for all children until 16 or 18 (can't remember). Now the same people who demandon't children be sent to school also demand that in order to go to school, they must be vaccinated. 

Now, now you might say, that's only for public schools, what about private schools and home/eschooling? There's a problem with that too. Roughly 40% of children in the US live in single parent home, which rules out the prospect of homeschooling and eschooling becomes unviable because it's illegal to leave your kids alone at home. You also have a large percentage of the population who can't afford or don't have access to private schools. The amount of overlap here has the potential to be very high, especially in poor neighborhoods. 

So, now we have a segment of the population for whom public school is the only option. What are the odds that some of these people do not want their kids vaccinated, for whatever reason (ignorance usually, but that's not the point)? Pretty high. So now the question becomes, are we willing to fine and or imprison parents because they don't want their kid to get a vaccine and therefore won't send them to school? Personally, that is not something I'm willing to do, so I'm against mandatory vaccination in order to go to school.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a legal perspective on the issue, specifically focusing on the First Amendment and the implications of religious exemptions. By highlighting the potential violation of the free exercise clause for religions that prohibit vaccination, Response 2 presents a strong argument for the necessity of considering both medical and religious exemptions in mandatory vaccination policies.",0
"There are few historical events/movements with a single cause.  More often than not, there are a number of factors that all added up, or a number of cases where if x hadn't happened, then y wouldn't have.  (For example, the Treaty of Versailles in itself didn't ""cause"" WWII. If Hitler hadn't been born, or of Churchill rather than Chamberlain had been PM in the early 30's, history would have been different).

ISIS is no different.  Without the Sunni/Shia divide, or many of the upheavals of the Arab Spring, ISIS as we know it wouldn't have happened.  

But without the invasion of Iraq (which in many ways precipitated the Arab Spring) it wouldn't have happened either.  Or the impact of Israel, which probably only still exists due to US intervention.  Or the vast sums of money flowing in from oil.  Or Iran, which exists in its current state due to the fallout from western support of the Shah.

If the Middle East had remained a poor desert, abandoned and ignored by the post-colonial West, there wouldn't be an ISIS. 

Did Bush cause ISIS?  Of course not.  But would it be what it is now without him?  Doubtful.  A strong Saddam and a strong Assad would probably have prevented it from happening.

Could Obama have prevented ISIS?  Sure, but at a cost that I don't think we'd have wanted to pay, in terms of military and money.  He didn't cause it, but I think if the US were willing to ignore world (and domestic opinion), it would have had the means to stop them.  But that doesn't equal responsibility. ","Okay, personally I find it more arrogant to suggest that the actions of our government have no effect on other nations. We have the largest military in the history of the world, by far. There are U.S. military bases all over. Have you ever seen War of the Worlds? Despite what you may think of that movie, imagine the humans in that movie are the people of the middle east, and the U.S. is the aliens. When you fuck with the way other countries operate, they get pissed.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more nuanced and detailed explanation of the various factors that contributed to the rise of ISIS, showing that it is not solely the result of one specific action or event. By breaking down the complex web of causes, Response 2 presents a more convincing argument that the actions of the US government were just one piece of the puzzle.",0
"It's not about monetary or practical impact, necessarily. It's about changing the discourse. A few decades ago, far fewer people were taking vegetarianism and veganism seriously. Now we have conversations about animal rights and welfare in public. There have been more animal cruelty related posts and comment threads on Reddit in the past year than I remember previously — and far less RAH RAH WHAT'S WRONG WITH EATING MEAT type replies. More and more restaurants are offering vegetarian and vegan options. Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, change will be sweeping and sudden.","I think I see where you are coming from, especially concerning one of your other answers where you said that it is very rare to meet vegetarians in your country. I'd say you look at it the wrong way, though.

As you said elsewhere, meat consumtion is rising. The reason for this is that it is easy and normal to eat meat, and not normal and harder when you do not. The more people that primarily eat vegetarian and vegan food, the more plausible it is for restaurants to sell vegetarian food, and the easier it is for people to choose to be a vegetarian, and the more vegetarian and vegan food is offered in other circumstances. In my region of the world, and then I mean maybe the closest 5 to 15 million people, the availability and accessibility of vegetarian and vegan options has risen dramatically in the last few decades, even though meat consumtion has risen as well due to changed habits of omnivores.. but this is turning, as of a few years ago. Omnivores are now lessening their amount of meat in their diet, and even more people are turning vegan and vegetarian or just ""I don't eat meat very often""-etarian, and it has gone to the point when arranging some events the crew don't even ask who is vegetarian, who is vegan anymore. They just simply offer vegan food for everyone instead, unless someone explicitly specify that they need meat, or whatever.

Since meat need approximately ten times as much land to produce the same amount of food as veggies, and meat production is said to stand for close to 20% of the amount of climate change gases, this may have an enormous effect. Not very much for each veg*n by themselves, but due to the effect they have in motivating each other, motivating others, making selling veggies plausible for restaurants, and in the end have a so much larger effect on the world than they ever would by themselves.

It's pretty much like voting, except they/we do it every day, so the possible effect is probably a lot larger.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of how individual choices to eat vegetarian or vegan can have a larger impact on society as a whole. It discusses the ripple effect of more people choosing plant-based diets, leading to increased availability of vegetarian options, reduced meat consumption, and ultimately a positive impact on the environment. This response appeals to logic and presents a strong argument for the benefits of vegetarianism and veganism beyond just personal health reasons.",0
"Unlike with pets, children are cared for by others on a regular basis. Kids get food at school, daycare, their grandparents and other family members, the parents of their friends, babysitters, the list goes on and on. You're holding 1-2 people responsible when there's likely a larger community effecting the child.

School lunches are the biggest one. Parents can't control what their child chooses to eat at lunch and many can't afford to pack lunches when their child can get a free or reduced price meal at school. Obesity and poverty run hand in hand, overweight children are more likely to be from parents who need their child to eat the maybe less-healthy option instead of packing them fresh veggies or whatever. 

Not to mention that your option is just BEGGING for abusive situations, both emotionally and physically. How much pressure would parents put on their kids to lose weight if it meant possible jail time? How many parents would hit their child for eating? How many kids would start to starve themselves because they're afraid mommy and daddy will go to jail? ","If we consider pure pragmatics and the wellbeing of the child, this is not effective. 

The desired behaviour is the child receiving proper nutrition and nutrition related modelling behaviour. The biggest barrier is parent behaviour and poverty: working poverty, fiscal poverty, generational poverty, knowledge, and habit. Criminalizing a behaviour is not as strong a deterrent as many people think (consider marijuana, piracy, and jaywalking). Charging the parents will not change their behaviours or make them more able to care for their children properly. Along with perhaps lacking motivation (this is arguable), these parents are often deeply lacking in skills, resources, money, and time. Charging them may strip them of even more money, community resource, and time. 

Charging parent for a younger child's weight also promotes child abuse via crash diets and laxatives, and rewards parents whose children may be malnourished but thin. Charging a parent for a school aged or older child brings into question the responsibility of the school as a nutritional provider and the child themselves.

Finally, I assume the outcome of an unpaid charge is jail or apprehension. Removal of a child from parental care is extremely damaging and expensive, and can lead to generational repercussions. It is only 'worth it' if the alternative is severe abuse or neglect. While childhood obesity could be called a form of neglect, the potential impacts of widespread institutionalization of otherwise happy children would be devastating.

To complicate things, there is strong evidence from a few recent studies that people do not know that their children are overweight (they literally don't see it). Punishing people for something they don't even know is happening and may not be able to control will not change behaviour at all.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a thorough analysis of the potential negative consequences of charging parents for their child's weight, including promoting child abuse, punishing parents who may not be able to control their child's weight, and the damaging effects of removing children from parental care. It also addresses the issue of poverty and lack of resources that many parents face, making it a more empathetic and comprehensive argument.",0
"Context: I'm a staff writer for a few music websites (including Sputnik! I'm Brostep there), and I work a lot with electronic music.

There are two major arguments I see against being very specific with genres:

1. Not all genres are, for lack of a better word, legitimate. There are certain genres, like the ones you've listed, which are generally agreed upon - I don't think there are many people who would argue that ""mathcore"" isn't legitimate. That said, there are other genres which are invoked very often, even though many, many people have argued compellingly that their very existence is kind of stupid. Take the whole dubstep sub-branching, for example. ""Dubstep"" is generally considered to be a legit genre - it's got quite a nice foundation in the London music scene, and people have been using it properly for a while. Same arguably goes for ""brostep"" (hence my username, though it's admittedly a touch tongue-in-cheek), which has been codified by enough well-established music blogs to have its existence justified. However, the dozens of other ""-step"" genres are the kinds of genres I would argue are not good at all. People who bandy about the terms ""chillstep,"" ""liquid dubstep,"" or ""trapstep"" (or, as we've seen in a few very public examples on /r/electronicmusic, ""Flumestep"" or ""feelstep"") are typically not the kind of people who have the scene-wide knowledge or experience to codify new genres of music, although they'll inevitably spread the word regardless. Thus, even though there's nothing really new being done (for example, Clubroot, Submotion Orchestra, and Phaeleh have all been doing what's called ""chillstep"" for years before that term was ever brought up), new, completely unnecessary genres are made up.

2. Genres can be very terrifying for newbies. I know that Dev was pretty merciless when I started writing for Sput, especially since I'd been inoculated with these genres that people who'd been in the scene for more than a year or two didn't use for fairly obvious reasons, and I'm surprised I didn't stop trying to delve into electronic music then and there. There are a lot of people like me out there, too. If we're sticklers about excessive genrefication - for example, if someone tries to call a song ""drumstep"" and people berate him because it's really more just half-time drum &amp; bass - that'll scare away the people new to the general style (whether metal or electronic), meaning that a potential opportunity to find a lot of really, really cool music has been totally lost. I'm sure you've seen this in comment threads, where someone will jump in and proclaim his love for whatever the new metal subgenre du jour is and other users will jump all over him for being inexperienced, and he'll leave the site forever. If we're sticklers about genres, we'll lose a lot of potential listeners.

So, to reiterate: genres can be good. However, not all genres are good, and not all enforcing of genres is good. ""Disdain of genres"" in general is one thing (though I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone of serious musical experience who just wants to call everything ""metal""), disdain of nonexistent genres (not mathcore, per se, but things like moombahcore and moombahstep) is another. And, of course, if we're too zealous in enforcing these genres (for example, if a user were to yell at someone for calling TTNG rock instead of math rock), we risk the destruction of a potential fanbase.","Someone has already talked about the ""illegitimate"" children of many genres, but I'd also say that the problem extends beyond that. Not all genres are well defined which leads to confusion and people who mislabel or generally disagree with how an artist is defined within a genre. Not all subgenres are accepted by their umbrella genres. Giving very specific subgenres names gives them a clear division. It physically separates one part of the community from the rest and creates a divide that otherwise might not exist. Especially around subgenres whose meaning is contested. The amount of passion involved in such debates can be alarming.

Also, many people blanket dismiss certain subgenres because they may know one or two artists from that subgenre that they don't like. But in another circumstance, they would say ""Oh, I don't like that artist but I might like this one"".

There are really good tools out there for finding similar music these days that focus more on relationships between artists and their listeners. While I think subgenres should not be dismissed, I think people also get way too caught up in labeling and strictly defining every new trend that comes along in music. People, to an extent, stop caring about the artists so much as their specific little subset of the community. I don't think that is necessarily a good thing.

",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a broader perspective on the negative aspects of being very specific with genres. It discusses how the division created by specific subgenres can lead to confusion, disagreements, and dismissals of certain subgenres. It also brings up the point that people may focus more on labels and definitions rather than the actual music and artists themselves. This more holistic view of the issue may be more persuasive in changing the OP's mind.",0
"Hiya!

I think I disagree because I don't think that this aspect alone could trump (no pun intended, honestly) any amount of good a President could do. Eliminating a President because of one flaw, no matter how severe, can be bad.

For instance, if you had 10 candidates that exaggerate their finances while you have 1 candidate who doesn't, but has policies that would essentially end the world due to their nuke trigger-happy beliefs, I definitely would not vote the last one for fear of Cold War: The Sequel (This time, it's personal).

I definitely would never vote Trump and Scott Walker either, but not for those reasons alone. Had they had incredible policies that would improve this nation better than the other candidates, I would have chosen them as the President despite this one aspect. There's a potential they may damage the economy somewhat, yes, but if their policies can make up for that, I'd choose them.

Unfortunately, the examples you gave are bad Presidents altogether, but concrete examples aside, the concept is there. This trait can be outweighed by goodness.","Scott Walker: Having $10,000 in credit card debt means nothing if you make $137,092 a year as he does. He can easily pay that off in two months, and possibly pay it off in one if he has few bills due that month. That is fiscally responsible. 

Donald Trump: A cursory Google search actually puts him at being worth 4 billion. So you do have a point of him. 

Edit: It should also be noted that the President has very little power or influence over the federal budget. Congress sets the budget and the President executes what they set by approving it, or he vetoes the budget. ",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more comprehensive argument by acknowledging the severity of the flaw in question but also highlighting the importance of considering a candidate's policies and overall impact. The example given about nuke trigger-happy beliefs effectively demonstrates that one flaw should not automatically disqualify a candidate if their policies are beneficial.

Caffeine is a drug. Just like any other drug, the high becomes addictive. which is why your friends enjoy the taste so much.

"&gt;What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion...

People are already free to practice their religion, they don't have to support LGBT people and they're not being forced to either. What they can't do, is impose their religious beliefs on other people, they can't get their religious beliefs enshrined into law. Religious people are in no way being oppressed by two gay people getting married, they just aren't allowed to dictate the rules on who gets to get married based on their religion.

","Ok freedom of religion does not entail a number of things, first and foremost, you are free to practice your religion and others are free to criticize you or yes make fun of you for it (which makes them assholes, yes, but they are free to do so, just as you are free to mock non-religious people)

"I think this is the crux of your post:

&gt;Although there may be a few exceptions to this, the majority of modern country is awful, redundant, and lacks any sort of meaning.

Can you honestly say that this doesn't apply to mainstream pop, rock, rap or anything else?  While we're at it, it also applies to movies, TV, books, subreddits, video games, etc, etc.

I think the problem isn't that country is mostly crap - it's that it's mostly crap - and you don't personally like the stuff that isn't crap.

Which is fine, but that's really about your personal taste, not the industry as a whole, as separate from any other artistic endeavor.

","I think you have a core misunderstanding of the country music as a genre. More then any other type of music, country music is about stories.

Combine with this that country music is also about a certain type of people. The music is aimed at those who live in rural environments. For home those stories are common and central to there lives.

Why do you discount style?  4 doors look terrible on almost everything, and so many people have absolutely no need for back doors.    I drive a corvette and have absolutely no need for them in that car.   

You're also missing the point that people with them have multiple cars usually.","Ultimately, a manual transmission will always give you more control, because the unit that controls it (the driver) can shift *proactively*, rather than an automatic transmission shifting *reactively* (i.e. in response to RPM and torque commands from the pedals).

This isn't actually true; most high performance cars come with selective shifting in the form of ""flappy paddles.""

"I did photography at a tennis event for some inner city 5th year kids. They're 10 years old and most of them had never heard of tennis.

"The problem with this train of thought is that the men who end up being the biggest ""studs"" are the ones who *don't* have to try as hard as the average guy.

"I'm going to take a different approach from the other posters by discussing what a ""socialist"" president would do and how it affects the argument.

Firstly, what does Bernie Sanders want?:

1. Universal Healthcare.
2. Universal Basic Income.
3. Free College Tuition.
4. A reigned in spying system.
5. An end to unnecessary military interventions.
6. An end to wall street profiteering.
7. Pro Renewable Energy and Anti Fossil Subsidies/Global Warming

That's basically what he is pushing for (as far as I know; Not sure what his position is on immigration).

Now you have to ask yourself how much these things cost.

1. Medicaid and Medicare cost a combined $773 Billion (2013, so before most of the ACA benefits kicked in). Couldn't find a solid number, but some of the private provider numbers imply private insurers made about $650 billion in revenues in 2010 which becomes about 700 billion if adjusted to 2013. Giving the cost of providing care to all the people in the system as of 2013 at about $1.47 trillion a year. If you factor in the uninsured (about 15% of the population). The same costs would be $1.73 trillion

2. The 2010 census says there are 243,275,505 adults and 74,181,467 minors. If every adult was given $12,000 a year and every child $4,000, the program would cost $2.919 Trillion for adults, and $298 billion for the children.

3. The amount of tuition charged in 2012 was $69 billion. If the number tripled every year for 12 years due to increased demand AND also increased 5% a year it would amount to $3.12 trillion or about $260 billion a year.

4. A few different sources say it is about 80 billion a year to run US Intelligence in general.

5. Iraq and Afghanistan cost the US anywhere between $4 and 6 Trillion depending on who you ask.

6. [This NYT article puts the cost of the 2008 recession at 4-25 trillion dollars.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/business/economy/the-cost-of-the-financial-crisis-is-still-being-tallied.html?_r=0) So let's split the difference and call it $14.5 trillion.

7. Fossil Fuel Subsidies cost $38 Billion Annually, Climate Change will cost 1.9 Trillion dollars by 2100, this amounts to about 24 Billion a year on average (these numbers are just for the Atlantic and Gulf States and don't take into account drought damage as I could not find a solid source for that(the likelier number is probably 3x that much).


So let's figure these numbers in to what we are currently dealing with.

1. Using United Healthcare as a basis, 4.6% of revenue is profit for private insurers. Most patented drugs are hundreds of times more expensive than they cost to make and hospitals jump at any opportunity to overcharge patients. [If this article is any indication, negotiating down the price of patented drugs could save as much as $200 Billion a year](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-best-selling-blockbuster-drugs-2012-6?op=1). If you take all these numbers and don't account for a number of other things that would further reduce costs (CEO pay, removing the middlemen, across the board forced negotiations), UH would cost about $1.48 Trillion and cover everyone.

2. All the various current forms of welfare amount to about $220 billion, removing redundancy lowers the actual bill to almost exactly 3 Trillion a year for this.

3. Removing existing government supported educational grants lowers the actual cost of this to $220 billion.

4. Even a 15% funding cut lowers the cost of intelligence to about $68 billion.

5. At 4 trillion since 2001 (the most conservative measures), just not being in afghanistan or iraq amounts to 286 billion a year.

6. This is 2.42 Trillion a year, between 2008 and 2015. if you assume these downturns happen every 20 years, then the actual cost is $725 billion a year (naturally adjusted to inflation).

7. This amounts to about 60 billion a year.

Alright, now there's all sorts of other factors. 

One of the most damaging factors to our economic growth is that employers in this country are saddled with the costs of providing their employees healthcare. As previously shown, this is both expensive and inefficient due to everybody in the chain wanting to profit. Universal healthcare would embolden EVERY employer in the US. [8% of civilian and private employee benefits and 11.6% of state and federal employee benefits are health/insurance benefits.](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecec.nr0.htm) If this windfall directly translated to jobs, the result would be 12.3 Million new jobs. If it only translated to a proportional 20% gain in new jobs, it would still result in 2.46 million new jobs.

Another factor: UBI money doesn't poof out of the economy the same way CEO pay does, the poor and middle class people would spend the majority of this new money. If 85% is put directly back into the economy (a reasonable number), it would result in 2.55 Trillion in new consumer spending. If you assume corporations will hire a new employee for every 1.5 million that they make, the result would be 1.7 million new jobs. Not to mention sales taxes boosting state revenues.

Free tuition would result in a couple 10k new high paying jobs (university staff) and a temporary boost of several 10k more construction employees for construction.

So what does a Bernie Sanders Presidency (where he gets everything he wants) get you?

Free Healthcare and Education for everyone. Enough Income to get most of your basic affairs in order. A much more stable world and economy. 5 million new jobs. If you cut 200B from the defense budget the result is a 5.5 Trillion yearly expense budget, in comparison to the current one which if you figure in the various wars and wall street instability is about 4.6 Trillion.


Factor in the dependant tax credit redundancy (-60 billion) and the fact that none of the 12 million illegal immigrants would receive these benefits (-112 billion), the final cost is an added 780 billion expenditure a year.

All of the new jobs and the resulting total increase in income tax revenues might well cover most if not all of the difference.

PS: If we perfectly matched Canada's Per Capita health expenditure, it would cost us 951 billion to cover everyone's healthcare. **This would lower the final added expenditure to only 251 billion.**

**TL;DR:** If you do everything Bernie Sanders wants, the result is an extra 251 billion in expenditures a year. If you don't include UBI (which is currently the most expensive thing and the hardest sell), you get a 2.6 Trillion *drop* in expenditures.

**Edit:** [His Proposition of a Robin Hood Tax. This would cover those extra 251 billion, dropping the final expenditure to -49 billion against the previous year.](http://www.robinhoodtax.org/news/blog/sen-bernie-sanders-officially-introduces-robin-hood-tax-act)","What spending do you feel is unnecessary? 

Here is a pie chart of all discresionary spending (2009 data):

Here is all spending (2012):

http://climbingthefinancialmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Federal-Spending-2012.png

So where are you cutting? 

Welfare and entitlement is a popular place. However, keep in mind that for every welfare dollar spent, the government collects somewhere over $0.60 in tax revenue. People who get welfare spend the money immediately in the economy, and that generates a lot of economic activity. So it's very difficult to actually close a budget by cutting safety-net programs.

Next up is Social Security and Medicare. These programs are funded through FICA taxes. They would both be fine if for some reason we didn't exempt all income over $118,500 from FICA taxes. Even with no changes, Social Security could continue to pay out 75% of current benefits forever. Meanwhile, CMS and medicare does all the actual hard work in health care. They establish the billing codes, decides what is reimbursed at what rate, etc. All the private insurers basically say ""we pay what medicare pays"" for everything. They do this while running a 3% overhead. For the purpose of comparison, private health insurers run 20-25% overhead. Any shift of healthcare from CMS to the private industry would me a massive loss of efficiency. Again, you can but things, but that doesn't mean you actually help yourself out in the long run.

You can rail against the US Dept of Education or the EPA, but the reality is that completely eliminating these programs are 1. not going to close the budget deficit, and 2. incur substantial societal costs.

Conservatives seem to see taxation and spending as inherently bad the for economy. This is simply not accurate. Money gathered by the government is injected right back into the economy. Money ""wasted"" on bureaucrats is money that is paid, as a salary, to consumers who then go out and use it to buy goods and services. This is why European countries are able to sustain tax rates that are significantly higher than the US and still have strong economic growth. Taxes are not bad as long as long as they are spent back into the economy. Here is a graph of GPD per capita:

http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/real-gdp-per-capita.png

As you can see, there is not a huge difference in economic growth rate between the US and Europe, despite the differences in taxation and spending policies.

In regards to the defecit, debt for governments is different than consumer debt. The first major difference is the interest rate. The US government is currently paying 2.13% interest on 10 year loans. That's basically equal to expected inflation over that period; in other words the US is borrowing money for free right now. Because it is seen as a 100% safe place to stash money, people are willing to give it to us to hold onto for a while. It is also denominated in US dollars. Conveniently, the US government is responsible for printing US dollars. It could literally print the money to pay off it's debts at any time. Printing money causes inflation, so the US government doesn't do this, but it could. The only way we could possibly default on our debt is through deliberate political action on the part of our government. It's like Debt is a room full of shit, except you make the shit, and you decide how much gets shoveled out every day. You have to control the level of the debt, but as long as you keep it stable over the long run it's not a terrible thing. In fact, when Clinton was president there was a lot of concern that the US government was going to pay off it's debts and there would be no more T-Bills. This caused a lot of anxiety among investors as they depend on treasuries to balance their risk.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with implementing Bernie Sanders' policies and shows that it is feasible to do so without significantly increasing the budget. The response also addresses potential job creation and economic benefits that could result from these policies, making a strong case for their implementation.",0
"Overall I agree with your point. I think it is largely detrimental to overall safety.

But as a counter argument:

Let's assume you can either argue for a person carrying pepper spray or against. Let's disregard the rationale for why you would argue for either for the moment.

Now consider a scenario where a person is faced with a choice between walking home at night through a not so nice neighborhood or taking a cab home. If the person feels safe enough, they will walk to avoid paying the cab, else they will pay and take the cab.

If the person is carrying pepper spray, they will feel safer. Let's assume that they feel safe enough to walk home if they are carrying pepper spray, but not safe enough to walk home if they are not carrying pepper spray.

So now we have three scenarios. Ranked from most risky to least risky they are: Walk home without pepper spray, walk home with pepper spray, and cab home.

If you do not have pepper spray, then you cannot walk home with pepper spray (obviously) and vice versa. So depending on your initial choice of advocating or not advocating for pepper spray, your options are limited from three to two scenarios.

From here I feel like you get where I'm going with it and to not belabor the point anymore: If you advocate for no pepper spray then a person who accepts you advice is more likely to take a cab, which is safer than walking with pepper spray.

Therefore, if we put aside reasons for arguing for or against victim protection, it is possible that arguing against victims protecting themselves produces a safer outcome.","I'm going to reverse the genders. 

How would you feel if you were told [this is how men should act to avoid false-rape accusations](https://i.imgur.com/7LXtLB5.jpg) ?

You would find it absurd. You would say it's absolutely stupid to adapt to a Dystopian society instead of trying to improve this society.

Many people have this misconception that rapes only happen to attractive and sexy dressed women in dark alleys. This is a cliche conveyed by Hollywood.

Rape doesn't necessarily comes from strangers, and it also doesn't only happen to women who dress up sexy. Many rapists do it more because of  domination/power/humiliation reasons than because the victim is visually attractive to them.

This means that when you start of the path of victim blaming, there is simply no limit because there is no point where women will be safe. It starts with asking people to dress differently and hang out in safe places, and it ends up with asking women to stay at home and cover themselves entirely.

Second thing is: women are *already* taking precautions, and they do NOT need a guide to know what to do. What they don't want is for the medias to present the rape situation as something women are partly responsible of. 

There are already too many people who still don't admit that rape is rape in some situations... and you want to perpetuate the idea that this is true? Your solution wouldn't make things better (as I said, women already know what to do), it would only make things worse.",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a strong argument by shifting the perspective to reverse genders and highlighting the absurdity of victim blaming.

"you aren't 100% wrong, but the reasons you're wrong are significant, i think.

for now, i'm going to take it for granted that you meant people with average facial structures were entirely capable of making themselves more attractive at large. you seem to not quite take that seriously the idea of people with facial structures that are simply unattractive straight up and only talk about extreme cases, but i feel like taking this approach gets more to the spirit of your post.

what i think is the key is to discuss the the fact that you said ""it's largely your fault"". not ""the causes are attributable to your lifestyle or choices"", or ""you played a significant role in it"", but ""fault"" implying that there's some blame involved, and there's some sort of responsibility to make yourself look more attractive. am i misinterpreting what you were getting at here? because ""it's your fault"" doesn't really feel like neutral phrasing. there definitely feels like some kind of lot of blaming going on here. 

you don't seem to really take seriously however, the idea that a lot of these conditions, and whether or not someone acts on them, is not fully in the control of the person it applies to. you seem like the kind of person who'd say 'no matter your conditions, if you have a choice in the matter, and you don't take that choice, you are 100% responsible, and frankly, might be a pussy for not makign that choice', am i right?

for more clarification: do you think say, given any let's sat 3/10 person, and if you found the right clothes, exercise routines, hairstyles, maybe makeup routines and hygein practices, they could be generally attractive? do you think that would really hold up and that facial attractiveness that falls below average can really just be propped up by dressing up everything else?","A lot of those things you mentioned (acne treatment, fashionable clothes, hair treatment, gym membership to lose weight) require money.

"Most holidays are hard to justify on paper. Why celebrate someone's birthday? It's really just an arbitrary marker that bears little on an individual's actual development. Christmas is a scam. Halloween is a scam. Easter (if you're not religious) is a scam. Mother's day: scam. On and on.

But you know what? I like these days, I don't care if they were pushed into being by cold and uncaring corporations. They are a part of our culture, and we chose to make that so. 

You could say that companies were just responding to a need (days of celebration) evidenced by how well they were received and embedded into the fabric of our culture. There are many 'holidays' you've never heard of, because they were never accepted by the public at large. The ones we celebrate, we celebrate for a reason.

Ignoring the consumerism for a moment, what I find important about these days is it does give you time to reflect. Mother's Day makes us ask ourselves ""Have I been showing my mom how much I love her?"" In the day to day hustle of life, it's easy to lose track of these things. Ideally, we'd never need a day, we'd just be thankful and appreciative all year round. But we tend to be focused on our own needs most of the time. Father's Day helps raise our awareness about what it means to be a good dad, or a good son or daughter for that dad.

I'm not going to try convincing you to love Father's Day, but I would urge you not to ""hate"" it. My dad actually sounds quite a bit like you, and honestly it saddens me the way he is. He is so hyper aware of social manipulation of this kind that he loses perspective. He takes on a cynical attitude towards these trappings and so becomes less emotionally receptive as a result. He thinks he's rebelling against culture, but really, he's just rebelling against his own family, closing off one small avenue to help strengthen bonds.

In the end, he accomplishes nothing with his rebellion in terms of reshaping culture, and ultimately starts to seem more a curmudgeon than anything. Being in such vehement opposition to something as trivial as a holiday doesn't make you brave or heroic, it just makes you an ass (not saying this about you personally, just in general). 

Your view of the world shapes reality. If you see Father's Day as consumerist bullshit, that is exactly what it will be for you. You will act in such a manner as to make it so. It's very easy to pick up on the vibe of your parents and respond in kind. Your kids could have had an opportunity to be extra loving on this day with you, and you could respond in turn. But alas, you are simply too above it. Too above a good excuse to be a bit kinder to each other. Is that really something worth fighting for? Is that the person you want to be? Is that how you want your kids to be?

Just try this. Be stupid for a day. On Father's Day, take it just as seriously as marketers would like you to. Get excited about all the gestures of kindness, material or otherwise, and make your appreciation clear to your family. You will be surprised to discover, that forced excitement and appreciation becomes real. What was before only a formality, becomes a catalyst for real emotional connection. When your family sees your warm reception, it will make them happy, which in turn will make you happy. Instead of reinforcing a cycle of cynicism, you are now reinforcing a cycle of love and kindness. Does it actually really matter how the day came about? You have an opportunity here, fucking *use it*.

Life may ultimately be meaningless, but each day we have the ability to create real meaning for ourselves, our friends, and our family. Father's Day may be bullshit, but it also represents one small opportunity to find true meaning. Not just find it, but to make it. To fail to understand this is to fail to make the best use of this short time we have.


^(This post sponsored by Hallmark.)
","I would try to convince you to appreciate Father's Day in much the same way I would try to convince someone who says ""I don't want to celebrate my birthday""; basically by saying ""Well, it's not really *for* you.""

When someone's birthday comes around, it may make them feel old or self-conscious to have people wish them well, but what a birthday really does is gives the ones who love the birthday-person the occasion to say ""YAY! You exist!  We get to celebrate the fact that you are in our lives and are special for existing!""  Now, this doesn't mean I don't love the birthday-person the other 364 days of the year, but their birthday gives me an excuse to make that love and appreciation tangible.  (And to be a bid morbid, people do choose to have birthdays; they can always ""opt out."")

And so I feel much the same way about ""Appreciation Days.""  It's not about them to ""reap the benefits"" of something they chose to do, but rather for the rest of us to say ""Yay, you did something, and we are really quite happy you did!""  

Finally, Appreciation Days also allow people to feel less guilt about being lavished with loot.  I don't have a dad, so I can't speak for Father's Day, but if I gave my mom gifts every time I felt appreciation for her existence, she'd feel guilty for all the money I was spending.  But because Mother's Day exists, I can get her a nice gift and she has to go ""Well, okay then.""

Now, if you have people in your life that few the appreciation of you on Father's Day as a burden, then I wouldn't like that day either.

"&gt;Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.

Prove it. This is a sheer question of fact: If ""the generalization is accurate"" in every case of harmful stereotype, then it shouldn't be hard to prove. If not, then you have to admit (if you're not being intellectually dishonest and are arguing in good faith) that you're succumbing to [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) and thus are flawed logically in this.

I don't have a ready source for this, but I remember it from a college class about critical thinking: on average, it takes 5 times of people defying stereotypes to counteract 1 person reinforcing that stereotype. 

So, are you sure that you're *really* not just seeing 20% of the population and applying it to the other 80%?","&gt; Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.

The problem is that its not strictly accurate on a individual level.  ""I am already a highly intelligent black person, what should I change so people stop stereotyping me as stupid?""

"Women need a certain minimum amount of body fat in order to carry a pregnancy to term and then breastfeed the child. In fact, there is a hormonal regulation mechanism that pauses the menstrual cycle and makes the woman infertile if her body fat falls below a threshold.

In the environment of adaptation, people were more likely to be malnourished than fat, hence males evolved a sexual preference to avoid investing time and effort to mate with females that looked too skinny, and females evolved to ""advertise"" their body fat by storing it in places where it is most visible in an upright position: the breasts and the buttocks. Co-evolution between male sexual preferences and female body fat distribution created a feedback loop that reinforced these characteristics.

Therefore the vast majority of men are instinctively attracted to large breasts and round firm buttocks. It has nothing to do with ""over sexualization"", it's just biology. (Note that this is different than just being attracted to ""fat"" women, in fact men are generally not attracted to women with an excessive waist-to-hip ratio, which correlates with poor health).

As for the topless thing, social norms about clothing vary greatly between cultures: In some Islamic countries women often cover head to toe in large burqas, while in some Oceanian tribes people walk around almost naked, women wearing a simple skirt and men wearing only a penis sheath leaving their scrotum exposed.

Clearly, Western cultural norms about clothing are somewhere in between. If you want to argue for different norms then you need a stronger argument than just debating the ""sexualization"" of any given body part.

","You're sorta right, not really. Womens breasts act in a manner that a evolutionary biologist would call a fitness indicator. If you've ever noticed, all mammals have mammary glands (breasts), but in nearly all cases, the mammary glands are very small until pregnancy happens. Humans are different. Human men evolved to find women with larger breasts more attractive because they tend to be more fertile. This caused sexual selection in favor of larger breasts, which benefitted women with larger breasts, allowing genes for large breasts to spread throughout the population. This is why men are attracted to large breasts, and why women have them.

Then of course, you claim that they are not ""sexual organs."" The thing is, I don't know what that means. They sure as heck aren't genitals, but they definitely are secondary sex characteristics. A secondary sex characteristic is basically a trait that one gender possesses that the other sex doesn't, yet still doesn't benefit reproduction. For example: arm, body, leg, or facial hair in men, additional muscle in men, breasts in women.

Actually, muscle and athletic ability act as a fitness indicator for men in a similar way as breasts do in women, so why do we only sensor women's breasts?

Not trying to argue against you, just bring some extra info to the table :)",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed explanation rooted in evolutionary biology about why men are attracted to women with larger breasts.

"The ability to never misspeak or have such hollow speeches that nothing can be taken out of context is not a good indicator of someone who will be a good legislator or executive. In the current climate of 24 hour news and internet fury over a mistake we are doing ourselves a disservice by keeping qualified people out of politics.

Who are the types of people who have no skeletons in their closet (or paid to cover them up) and do research to figure out how people will react to every word you say? Only the rich and most power hungry. By saying everybody ought to speak perfectly all the time we are selecting the most out of touch people to be fun our government. It's really concerning actually.","Many of the problems we face today (institutional racism is a good example, but so are climate change, income inequality, and partisan gridlock) are extraordinarily complex in their causes.  Any meaningful discourse about real, workable solutions to these complex problems will necessarily need descriptions that defy brief, quotable sound bytes.  You say ""a good candidate is one who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context""-- in other words, you are asking for a candidate whose speeches consist only of empty platitudes, and ignore all issues that are sufficiently complex as to require some ""setup lines"" in order to explain.  


While it is true that the media prefers to focus on out-of-context sound-bytes (because this allows them to engage in low-effort, high-reward ""gaffe journalism""), we the American people should push back on this tendency if we are ever to have any hope of a public discourse that is actually constructive.  You may be so cynical as to believe that no politician will ever be willing to take up these problems meaningfully; nonetheless, that's how our system is designed, and if they don't, no one else can.  Part of our responsibility as citizens is to demand accountability not just from our elected officials, but from the news media who cover them.  The Internet has actually revolutionized fact-checking, and made it very difficult for erroneous or misleading news stories like the one you describe to survive very long before being called out.  This, in my opinion, is a good thing for democracy.

"Well I can think of a couple of situations where your tattoo could hurt your chances for employment if it is particularly offensive or obscene.

For one, you sometimes get job offers at weird places. For instance I met a member of an accounting firm (I'm an accounting major) at a baseball game and got offered an interview. There was also a ""meet the firms"" night at a restaurant near campus that I accidentally stumbled upon and met many job prospects there.
Also, during my internship, we participated in some outdoor activities after work, like playing kickball with the employees, which helped you meet other people at your firm and helped make a good impression. 

My point is that you can't always rely on covering up a tattoo because sometimes you run into job opportunities or situations unexpectedly. Of course this only really applies if your tattoo is obscene or offensive, because most employers could care less if you have a tattoo as long as it isn't like, on your face or something.",Some firms don't like their employees having tattoos and they do discriminate.

"That's like saying that writing a good book doesn't take skill, just time and a pen and paper.

Additionally, the mention of record companies knowing how to make money adds a layer of credibility to the argument.",0
"I have been trained to use tranquilizers on animals, and they are a nightmare to get right.  

First off, the doses of even the best drugs tend to be very sensitive.  We have to estimate the weight of the animal and put the correct amount of the drug in the needle.  While a good drug can account by us being off by a bit, it does not account for the danger of using a dose for a creature twice the size or bigger.  As humans have a large range of potential body sizes, that means that the police would not be able to have the darts pre-loaded and ready to go, but rather have to load up a dart with the drug while in pursuit and estimating their size.  That changes the time between deciding to use the weapon and using it from a few seconds to a few minutes (if not longer), which can mean the difference between life and death in a situation where using either weapon is needed.

&gt;And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier?  They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

A 250 lbs man holding a 100 lbs woman still means that if she gets a dart meant for him in her, she will likely die.

Secondly, even in a perfectly healthy subject, there is a great deal of possibility of complications.  These drugs work by relaxing the muscles and/or paralyzing them, but that also applies to muscles like the diaphragm and heart.  When sedating an animal, we have to closely monitor their breathing and temperature to make sure that the drug is not causing problems and potentially administer counter agents.

Third, many humans already have drugs in their system, both legal and illegal.  Without knowing exactly what they have in them, it is impossible to know how the tranquilizer will interact.  It may make it useless, it may make it deadly, it may drive them into a berserker rage.  Without their medical history in from of us and a pharmacist, we cannot know.

Fourth, tranquilizers take a while to take effect.  It sometimes takes as long as several minutes after the drugs enter their system for it to impact them.  With an animal, we can easily sit back and observe them from a distance until they collapse, but with a criminal it will just give him a few minutes of doing whatever dangerous activity he is already engaged in.  Some people may react to being hit by a dart with anger and become more violent.  Also, if they happen to know the drug the police use, they may have a syringe of a counter-agent with them and be able to use the time to nullify the effect.

Fifth, darts are far less accurate than a regular bullet.  Distance must be carefully estimated and applied to whatever launcher is used.  Overestimating distance means the dart will not hit with enough force and not penetrate skin or will drop too much and miss entirely.  Underestimating distance means the dart not dropping enough and overshooting the target or hitting and doing severe damage with the impact.  This means that the chances of the police hitting their target at all are very low, and they must engage from a much shorter distance.

Finally, the darts are very difficult to get to inject even when they hit the target.  Often times simply fur is enough to stop a successful hit from injecting the drug and cause it to simply spray the outside of the animal.  A heavy coat, leather jacket, or a wide range of other possible clothing options can easily do the same thing and prevent the drug from entering the system of the target even on an accurate shot.

Overall, if I am going up against gun bearing criminal with either a tranquilizer gun or a baseball bat, I will take the bat because I will be more likely to win and I will be less likely to kill the criminal in the event of a victory.","Have you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance. This is because it's not easy to knock someone out, and it's even harder to do it without hurting or killing them. 

I'm no expert on tranquilizers but I know they are not the instant knock out guns movies make them appear to be. You have to get the drug in their system and it needs time to work. Time a person could use any number of ways, some dangerous.

Also, more importantly in my opinion, you're putting the person shot a risk. You're injecting an unfamiliar drug into their system. They could be allergic, or it could have an averse reaction with some other legal or illegal drug that they're taking. It could hurt them, cause permanent damage, or even kill them.

This comprehensive breakdown of the limitations and risks associated with tranquilizers makes a strong case against their use in law enforcement scenarios.",0

The long term negative effects of obesity (like bad health, or in your example, expensive pants) are already known to virtually everyone. The reason those don't stop someone who wants to eat junk food right now, is that they won't affect him or her within weeks of them making the choice to eat a pizza. For something like this to be effective, the ""punishment"" must happen regularly and quickly after the bad choice is made.",1,2,False,Response 2 provides a more nuanced argument by explaining the psychological aspect of immediate gratification and delayed consequences.

"&gt; This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect.

I think you will find that as a parent, this would be an impossible situation. You say that ""respect needs to be earned"", but isn't this a two way street? Maybe you think the parent who says ""because I said so"" hasn't done enough to earn the child's respect. But has the child done anything to earn respect either? If the parent tried to rationally explain why they're right to the child, how confident are you that the child will understand and ""can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out"". If they can't, then a rational two-way discussion just isn't going to happen.

And if such a discussion can't happen yet, what now? Should the parent and child just ""agree to disagree""? Of course not. I wouldn't frame it as some kind of ""debt"" that arises out of giving birth, but I think its pretty widely acknowledged that parents are responsible for their child's behavior, even before the child is wise enough to understand complicated reasoning. As a third part, I *expect* other parents to keep their children in line, even if their children aren't smart enough to understand why certain behavioral expectations exist.

And similar phenomena happen for all positions of authority. If a police officer is directing traffic, he doesn't have to explain to you the details of what's going on. You have to listen to him anyway. ""Because I said so"" would be a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say when him explaining what's going on in more detail would hold up traffic (especially if you then decide for whatever reason that you disagree). Similarly, there are many employer-employee relationships where ""because I said so"" should be good enough for you. One hopes that there is a good reason behind the requests, but the employee is in no way entitled to a full breakdown of exactly why everything works the way it does, especially when time is of the essence. Its embedded into the nature of these relationships that you follow orders.","In principle, I agree with you that parents do not simply deserve unconditional respect just by virtue of being their parents. But there are several aspects that I'd like to comment on.

First of all, your parents changed your diapers and by the time you're even just 5, they've invested a whole lot of time and money in you. That is enough to deserve some respect and gratitude. That doesn't mean they can't lose it because they do crappy things, but it is worth quite a bit in itself, and it does deserve respect.

In the case of arguments, there's two points that I think are important. First of all, you'll have found that there are many situations in life where ""because I said so"" is something you'll have to submit to if you want to achieve certain goals. Ever had a job? Ever had a boss who told you what to do? Did they always talk you through the reasons for the required actions step by step? It would be nice if they did, because even in a job I'd quite like to know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but they're not required to because they give you money.

If your parents say you can't wear a cap at the table because they said so, then that's fair enough. They're feeding you. You're free to get up and move out and buy your own food, but as long as they're providing for you, they can make rules, even if the rules are stupid and arbitrary and you don't agree with them. I personally don't think that's a very good attitude and I hope I won't be that kind of parent, but I can't really argue with it.

Also, I've had similar conversations with parents because, as I said, I do in principle agree with you, and I'd very much like to be a parent who explains things to their children and encourages them not to take things for granted or as given without questioning them. But I've been told that this just gets tedious sometimes. Maybe you spend 15 hours a day actively dealing with your child. Children ask all the questions and want to do all the things, and if you at some point run out of patience and don't want to explain something for the nth time, I think saying ""because I said so"" is still not ideal, but perfectly understandable. 

With your last statement, I'm not sure which age you have in mind. But people of any age really sometimes suck at logic, and children even more so, so there are arguments that can't be solved this way because no side will admit out of their own accord that they're wrong. And in some cases there isn't even necessarily wrong or right, because it depends on how much you care about certain things. You can't drag arguments out forever. You need to get on with your life at some point. ",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more structured and logical argument for why parents may use the phrase ""because I said so"" and why respect should be given to parents even if the child doesn't fully understand the reasoning behind their decisions. It also provides examples of other authority figures in society where similar dynamics exist. Response 2, while acknowledging the importance of respect and gratitude towards parents, focuses more on personal anecdotes and hypothetical scenarios rather than providing a strong argument for why ""because I said so"" can be a valid response from parents.",0
"1) What do you propose is done with the West Bank?

First, the region has always been populated by people. The native bedouin people have lived in that region far longer than you seem to be giving them credit for. Most of them migrated there between 1300 and 1700. Quite a long time for a place that so inhospitable. 

Also, Israel might have been ""mostly dessert"" but the whole reason we need a Palestine state is because of the millions of people the Israel state forced into refugee status by making them leave. It might have been mostly dessert, but damn, it was home to a lot of people. 

Egypt certainly could offer the things you mentioned to the Bedouin people. Egypt has abjectly refused to do so, and has created a terrible caste system whereby terrorist groups have thrived in the region, so I do not see this happening anytime soon.

"This could be region specific, but folks around where I live (Northern Suburbs of the City of Atlanta) stop and chat with one another all the time. It's difficult to walk on the local college campus without being dragged into some conversation or other.

Getting drawn into a conversation that requires significant time to come to a bigger realization and a better understanding of the world isn't necessarily the best idea in those situations.

In addition, those servicemembers all served overseas. In fact, Vietnam was similar - the US maintained more troops in West Germany during this time than in Vietnam. Conscripts weren't sent just to fight in Vietnam - many were sent to fill in ranks in Germany to keep our obligations there.

The problem is, you don't usually criticize people for not adhering to your preferences. ""I am not attracted to tall girls"" is fine, ""ew, girls should never be tall!"" Is not. ""Slut"" is a word with that kind of judgment/criticism built in, and when people are called out for acknowledging a woman's promiscuity, it is usually because they are being critical.

I would be hesitant to date a girl who has been with over 20 guys because I would worry about her ability to commit. Likewise, I'd have reservations about dating a girl who is a virgin at 25. But I would never criticize or call her names like ""slut.""",1,2,False,Response 2 provides a more nuanced perspective on the issue by highlighting the difference between personal preferences and judgmental attitudes. It acknowledges that it's okay to have preferences but emphasizes the importance of not criticizing or shaming others based on those preferences. This approach is more likely to resonate with the OP as it addresses their concerns about promiscuity and commitment without resorting to derogatory language.,0
"The opposition to interracial marriage was based on the belief that certain races were genetically inferior (whatever that means). Yes, people cited their religion for reasons, but ultimately that's what it would come back to (for the most part). Since 'genetic inferiority' is a scientific claim, it requires scientific evidence to support it. There is none, in fact there is plenty to disprove it. So interracial marriage happened without problem. (I like what other commenters have said about interracial marriage not changing the definition of marriage). 

Opposition to same-sex marriage is based on opposition to specific *actions*, and not wanting the government to sanction and support those actions. People who are opposed to same-sex marriage would also be opposed to two heterosexuals of the same sex getting married. The marrying couple's sexual *orientation* is not the target of disapproval, it's the *actions* of two individuals. (Yes, I am aware that many people who oppose same-sex marriage also actively hate or are at least grossed out by gay people--but that is irrelevant to a discussion of the possible social repercussions of legalizing same-sex marriage.) The fact that certain people are biologically predisposed to want to do those actions, and others are completely *not* interested in doing them, is a confusing side note to this argument. 

This is a distinction that will probably be hard to make sense of, especially since I had trouble trying to explain it. Let me know if you have points you'd like clarified. 

I'd like to echo what others have said, and what has been said for the past several years: The government's interest in marriage is in harboring a place to raise successful citizens. Every solid study I've read up on shows that a child's best chance is to be raised by its biological parents*. Whenever possible, the government supports this with tax breaks and by attaching things like inheritance and hospital visitation rights to marriage. Since the child of same-sex partners cannot be raised by both biological parents, they are automatically at a disadvantage. At least, that's the argument. 

*I know there are studies out there that suggest that same-sex parents are just as likely to raise successful children as the biological parents. Every one of these studies that I've looked at has been deeply flawed--usually with non-random samples (parents who volunteer for a study about successful parenting are probably going to be the ones who are doing pretty well), extremely small sample sizes, or by comparing a population of same-sex parents that got their children through the difficult and expensive process of adoption to a population of heterosexual parents of all types--adopters, planned parents, accidental parents, etc. From what I understand, the meta-study the Supreme Court cited in their decision was a study of these flawed studies. Feel free to link a good study on same-sex parents. ","The fundamental difference between state sanctioned interracial marriage and gay marriage is what they are promoting as a social norm. In interracial marriage the norm that is being promoted is that people do not need to be kept separate because of their racial characteristics, that integration of racial groups is a social good that we want to promote (or at least isn't an ill that should outweigh the good of marriage).

Gay marriage is an attempt to normalise a certain types of sexual relationships by raising their legal status and making them legally equivalent to others.

They are quite different things….",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a detailed explanation of the difference between opposition to interracial marriage and opposition to same-sex marriage. It breaks down the argument into the basis of opposition, focusing on actions rather than orientation. It also brings up the government's interest in marriage and the potential disadvantages for children of same-sex parents. This response addresses the core arguments against same-sex marriage and provides a nuanced perspective.",0
"&gt;Cities have significantly better municipal services.

While this is true, the people who live in the country don't value these things the same way as people who live in the city. They don't care about 4G LTE, and likely don't even have a phone to utilize it. They may not like it that the city is bigger (this isn't inherently a better thing), and while you mentioned that cities are safer, I'm not so sure thats a true statement. I think crime is much more common within the city than in rural areas. Plus, people in rural areas are likely confident in their abilities to defend themselves and their families in dangerous situations, and don't necessarily want to have to depend on the municipalities for that. 

Basically, if you are used to living in the city, then you place value on all the things you listed about municipal services. If you live out in the country, you're used to getting by without them and they don't necessarily have the same value.

&gt;Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

Again, this is something that some people may actually see as a downside to the city. People used to living in a rural area might not like the hustle and bustle of the city, and enjoy spending recreational time doing things out in nature. People may not like malls, and they may not actually meet any like-minded people within the city.

&gt;Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity

This isn't something that everybody values. Some people enjoy daily interactions with the same people, and enjoy being in a community where they are recognized and have long standing histories with people. 

&gt;bugs

Maybe people in the country are indifferent to bugs? I don't know

&gt;In the country, everything is high maintenance

I'm fairly sure its cheaper to live in rural areas than it is to live in the city. Even if it is true that more maintenance is required, people typically do their own maintenance and perhaps don't mind it.

TL;DR People who were born in rural areas have a completely different set of values than someone born in a city. All of the things you listed as upsides to living in the city, they may see as downsides, and vice versa. Your world view is shaped by your experiences, so if your experience is living in the country, then your world view is vastly different than someone who has experienced nothing but city life.


"," I think there's a trade off for everything. You're accustomed to having everything as fast as you want it. Country people aren't. They know and accept some things are going to be a hike.

It's also possible you don't really ""hear"" the noise around you all the time like someone who hasn't grown up with it or lived in it for many years, would. Silence is golden, and if you live in an area where you can never have that, it can drive some people mad. 

It's difficult to say one is ""better"" than the other. I'd vouch both have their bonuses. 

The quiet, the privacy the country affords, the beauty of it. Enjoying nature, having a big garden, maybe even some farm animals. You can't do those things in the city and those things sure can keep people, very busy. 

The bugs one though, come on. You know as well I do there are many cities with very nasty bug problems. 

",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of how people's values and experiences shape their preferences for living in either the city or the country. It addresses each point made in the original post and provides counterarguments based on differing perspectives. Response 2, on the other hand, acknowledges the trade-offs between city and country living but does not delve into the specific values and experiences that may influence these preferences.",0
"I think you're making a selectively negative reading of US history that doesn't account for the enormous human progress that has been made in substantial part due to the existence and persistence of the United States.

&gt;The American Revolution: It did involve great thinkers and advancement of political philosophy, but the French did it better, 

WHAT?!

The French Revolution was a disaster!  Their first elected government was [overthrown by a violent mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_August_\(French_Revolution\)) and [started a war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars) that would persist for a decade to come.  Their domestic government quickly turned into [a totalitarian dictatorship that murdered tens of thousands of political enemies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror) and was then succeeded by a [reactionary coup d'etat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction).

And after all that, what did France get?  [Napoleon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) who was a dictatorial and warmongering emperor.

The American Revolution was followed by peace, the establishment of an actually elected government, and when problems did arise, a peaceful solution in the form of the Constitutional Convention.  The transition from Adams to Jefferson after the brutally contentious election of 1800 was probably the first peaceful transition of power between political adversaries in a sovereign state the world had seen for over a thousand years.

&gt;and American Revolution was an overreaction to British enforcement of fair taxes that paid for the 7 Years War to protect Americans.

It was a mutual escalation, with colonial tax protests being met with [excessive reprisals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts) from the British crown.  [Many within the British Parliament sympathized with the Americans](https://almostchosenpeople.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/edmund-burke-and-the-american-revolution/) and thought the government was being foolish, even if sentiment was generally that they shouldn't have gone to war.

&gt;-Industrial revolution: Granted high developments in technology and economic prowess were built on slavery, child labor, discrimination against immigrants, poverty and greedy, amoral robber barons and corrupt politicians.

I think you're putting a far more negative gloss on this than is justified.  First, most of the massive economic growth of the US took place after the Civil War, and were not primarily driven by slave labor at any point.  Second, the effects of that economic growth on human wellbeing across the country today are enormous.  Standards of living are very high in the US today, and there is no country on Earth which has industrialized without having poor labor market conditions in its early industrial period.

Also, immigrants to America in this era weren't dupes.  They moved here because America really did offer opportunity to make a life for yourself that wasn't available anywhere else in the world at the time.

&gt;Civil War: The fact that it needed to happen and that a flag that represents those who fought to defend slavery is still being flown and celebrated is disappointing.

Obviously slavery is a dark mark on American history, and I have nothing to say in its defense, except that the north could have let the south secede, and a major reason that it did not play out that way was a moral opposition to slavery.

&gt;World War 2: Significant military power, certainly helped turn the tide, still killed 300,000 civilians with atomic weapons and put Asian Americans in camps (with little reparation that came way too late).

Again, nothing to say in defense of internment, but will note that the US did not start WWII, and did not fully enter it until it was attacked by the Japanese and declared war on by the Germans.  War is nasty business though, and if you're looking for a war fought by ethical means, you'll never find one.

&gt;Of course there are worse countries in the world, but current day America is a wreck. Frequent mass shootings that don't really happen in other developed countries, continued high race tensions, religious fundamentalism in the South and a poor education system. So tell me CMV, is there any reason to celebrate or be proud of my country?

Current day America has problems, but we're not a wreck.  Crime is way down, our economic situation is doing much better than most other developed countries,  and we still have a reasonably functional government which allows for peaceful political discourse and meaningfully defends Americans' civil rights.

Is it perfect?  Hell no.  Is life in contemporary America one of the best places and times in human history to be alive?  Yes.  And that's saying something.","&gt;America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love 

Really? I completely agree with you that America has done a lot of terrible things (and I think you're actually leaving out [some of the worst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs)), but America, and Americans, have also done some really amazing things.

The American Revolution directly inspired the French Revolution (which ended up with a dictatorship, if you'll recall, hardly ""doing it better"" imo). We were instrumental in stopping the Nazis, and accepted far more refugees from them than anywhere else. We cured polio. One single American has been credited with [""saving a billion lives""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug). We invented the Internet. We make most of the world's pop culture, and have for over a century (Bollywood notwithstanding).  We have produced 353 Nobel Prize winners, beating out the second place country (Germany) by more than a factor of three. We invented jazz, hip-hop, and rock and roll.

These are all just off the top of my head. America has done a lot of bad stuff, for sure, but it's also been an enormous source of innovation and invention. It's just ridiculous the amount of stuff that has come out of America.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a detailed and nuanced counterargument to the OP's negative view of American history. It addresses each point made by the OP and provides a more positive perspective on the historical events mentioned.

"I study media representations a little bit and might be able to address the points you raise.

You first point, that there are a ton of bad-ass female characters, may seem subjectively true but in the general demographic context of video games it is incorrect. There are certainly quite a few notable examples of bad-ass female characters but, in general, females are dramatically underrepresented in video games. A [content analysis of 150 video games from 2009](http://nms.sagepub.com/content/11/5/815.abstract) found that 85% of all video game characters were male. Of the 15% of characters that are female, the ""bad-ass"" characters are most definitely the exception. And even the ""bad-ass"" female characters are often still portrayed in highly gendered and sexualized ways. So even though you can call to mind several examples of non-helpless female characters, the fact remains that females are dramatically underrepresented and non-helpless female characters are only a portion of the already small number of female characters in video games. So, I don't think saying there are ""a ton of bad-ass female characters"" is an accurate reflection of actual video game demographics.

Your second point will probably be the more difficult one to change your mind about. You doubt that there is any connection between the way women are portrayed in video games and the way people think about and behave towards women in real life. Without getting too academic, I'll say that every person can be thought of as the result of a whole bunch of psychological and cultural ingredients. Some ingredients predispose a person to be a certain way and do certain things, while other ingredients do the opposite or cancel out effects. What this means is that it's never as simple as saying ""exposure to sexualized women will make someone a hostile sexist"" or ""exposure to violent video games will cause someone to be a violent criminal."" There are way too many other things going on to be able to make such a direct causal statement. However, repeated exposure to certain things most definitely changes the way you think about them, and these changes in the way you think about things then becomes one of the ingredients that makes you who you are and influences what you do. 

For an academic look at how we are all products and perpetuators of the society's we're part of the products we create and consume, read [this](http://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2010-Markus-Kitayama_Culture-and-Self-A-cycle-of-mutual-constitution.pdf).

So with that said, let's talk about evidence that the media we consume can change the way we think about things. In another comment here, /u/fluffhoof mentions [this study](https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2013/fox-chb-sexualized-virtual-selves.pdf) about the psychological effects of embodying a sexualized avatar. As a contrast to the single study you shared about violent video game effects, a [meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of violent video games](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20192553) found that playing violent video games was related to increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect, as well as decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. There are plenty of other examples where these come from and they all suggest that the kind of media we're exposed to can have real effects on the way we think about ourselves, and certain people and issues. Just because you don't become a hostile sexist or violent criminal after playing video games doesn't mean that they didn't have an effect on you.

Most of us probably have enough other ingredients in us that have to do with being egalitarian and reasonable and peaceful or whatever else, that the effects of exposure to this kind of media don't manifest themselves in obvious ways. But if you are repeatedly exposed to portrayals of women as helpless and sexualized, you will most likely think of women differently than if you hadn't been repeatedly exposed to those portrayals. And even if the only effect that exposure to these portrayals has on us is that we accept these portrayals as ""good"" or ""normal"" or ""typical of women"" or even just ""not unusual"" or ""not bad"" then it does a disservice to women in society by continuing to limit the way women are perceived and allowing the cycle of biased representations to continue.

Also, your girlfriend's point that ""you won't ever understand because you're a guy"" is absolutely true. You (if you're a male living almost anywhere in the world) have lived your life in a world where men are abundantly represented in real life and the media. Not only that but men are portrayed in a huge variety of ways: in positions of power, prestige, and notoriety as well as in positions of poverty, shame, and powerlessness, and so on. The point is that men have long enjoyed a very wide spectrum of representation, meaning that when someone thinks ""What is a man like?"" there is ample information to draw from and one can selectively draw from information that portrays men favorably. Women (and minorities) do not have that experience. Women are underrepresented in most media and they are represented in much narrower and limited ways than men are. So when one asks the question ""What is a woman like?"" the information one draws from is likely to be more scarce and more biased and this is likely to contribute to the perpetuation of people thinking that women are different than men in ways that they really aren't.

I get it if my arguments for subtle media effects having important consequences for society are hard to buy into. I get that a lot. One way or another, thanks for reading! :)","It is not easy (for me at the moment at least) to find studies that look at how representation in media influences how we think about and treat certain groups or how certain groups behave and think about themselves. 
For many people it is obvious that if for example a little black kid sees that the hero in the movies he watches is always a white guy, and people that look like him are only side-characters that might influence (not determine) the way he thinks about himself, the things he considers himself capable of and the things he goes on to pursue. And that media also influences what other people think he is capable of. Same could be said for representation of gender. This goes not only for movies but media in general. 

The expectation we have of certain groups (gender, race, orientation etc.) come largely from the society we life in and the things we perceive as normal or given. The alternative would be that we are born or naturally develop gender roles or stereotypes even without any interaction, to me that seems highly unlikely. I don't think that we are able to form our subconscious biases only by real world interaction without even being influenced by 'imaginary' content, like for example video games. 

However, you are right, that just because something seems obvious that doesn't mean that we don't need to go searching for scientific proof. 

Here is one study that I could find; 
&gt;To give one example of this effect, we know that (for reason not relevant here) women and minorities are underrepresented in media especially when it comes to characters that are professionally successful. There was a study done ""that finds evidence of a self-esteem boosting effect of television for white boys, but self-esteem damaging effects for white girls, black girls, and black boys.  One primary reason?  White boys see lots of white boys and men in the shows they watch.  And, not just that, but they regularly see these characters and actors in positive, powerful, and central roles."" ([quote](http://egrollman.com/2012/09/24/representation/), [source](http://crx.sagepub.com/content/39/3/338.abstract)). 

A quote from a [2000 paper](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/538/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1007046204478.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1007046204478&amp;token2=exp=1436542114~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F538%2Fart%25253A10.1023%25252FA%25253A1007046204478.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1023%252FA%253A1007046204478*~hmac=51f00906ba32d92292afd3dd80b6cca77d2c421d643bfd535be5c938b2c083ac) I could find that explains the process of how media might influence stereotypes:
&gt;Media analysts often use the concept of ‘‘frame’’ to explain how television imagery influences people (Entman, 1993; Gamson, Croteau, Hoynes, &amp; Sasson, 1992; Gitlin, 1980; Goffman, 1974). Although recent audience studies reveal that viewers do not automatically mimic what they see on television, the imagery they observe facilitates specific forms of understanding, interpretation, and experience (Press, 1991). Media images provide a diffuse confirmation of one’s world view, promote acceptance of current social arrangements, and reassure people that things are the way they ought to be. In social psychological terms, media images become incorporated into cognitive schema and heuristics, and are called up during processes of identity formation, self-evaluation, attribution, and social comparison. 

In the absence of more prove (that I could find) you could read up on the psychological process of stereotype development and schemata and decide for yourself if you think it is likely that these things are influenced by media. You could also talk to people with little children and ask them about how their kids react to representation in media or look online for people describing their experience. 

So far, you haven't been delivered absolute scientific prove. However, I'm also not aware of proof of the opposite viewpoint that representation does *not* influence us. Given that representation is indeed very poor for women and minorities (there's lots of scientific proof for *that*) and that many people are upset with this and wish it were better I at least see no reason to argue for the contrary.

Response 2 also acknowledges the complexity of human behavior and the multitude of factors that contribute to it, which adds depth to the argument.",0
"Nobody really cares about an honest exhange of culture. That's not really cultural appropriation.

People get bent out of shape about it when people take bits and pieces of a culture out of context, without understanding it. Then, usually, those contextless items are commodified without the originating culture's consent or benefit.

Imagine the following scerario: some aliens decide to drop in on humanity, and they decide to wear coture dresses with pope hats and sneakers because they like keeping their jimmies cool, value comfort, and that's just a nice hat. Everybody everywhere would be snickering at their choice, but they would haughtily remind us that they are the more advanced species, so they are doing it right. Meanwhile, they take their dresses and pope hats back to the central galaxy and make more money than the earth is worth on their ""fantastic artisanship"" that they totally didn't just take directly from a Payless store. Earth remains disconnected from the galactic sphere, and all the dubbed virtual reality simulations they *do* send us back portray aliens dressed up as ""humans"" in their dresses and pope hats, and we all like cheese because the aliens found that hilarious. Those coture dresses are dismissed as 'tribal costumes' and we are the backward butts of jokes -- not the people who wore a damn pope hat and sneakers and called it 'cool'.

Okay, so that's pretty absurd, but that's exactly what we tend to do to other cultures right here on earth.

To bring it back to your original BDSM party example, if people culturally appropriated from BDSM culture, it would suck. It would consist of taking things out of context, not caring about the important underlying things that make BDSM safe(r) and getting it (likely deadly) wrong. People would end up going to the hospital because they didn't know how to tie the ropes right, and didn't think it important to learn how before their hand turned black from constriction or something. They'd do things like wear a locking gag without having a safe command (like, ""hey spotter, if I pound my fist three times, that means break out the emergency shears and get this thing off me!"") so they end up choking to death. Now, everybody forms the opinion that BDSM is unsafe and should be banned, because just look at what happened!? *Obviously* that culture has something horribly wrong with it. That's cultural appropriation. Playing cricket worldwide is not.","I think you are misunderstanding the point of cultural appropriation.  It's not that only a member of a given culture has any right to use objects, designs, patterns, etc. that come from that culture.

The biggest problem is when other people borrow one piece of a culture without taking a moment to understand context.

A prime example is the [war bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bonnet), as it's frequently appropriated.  

In reality, a war bonnet is an object with deep cultural, or even spiritual importance.  They're used almost exclusively for ceremonial purposes.  The feathers aren't just given away, they're earned by acts of valor, or other service to the tribe.

When people wear them just as some sort of [fancy hat](https://www.google.com/search?q=war+bonnet+hipster&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=839&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIkeC0naXCxwIVCBGSCh3Q1wn-), that shows a deep lack of respect for another culture.  It's not just that you're taking an object, it's that you couldn't be bothered to even simply understand what that object actually means.

It would be somewhat similar to someone from another culture coming along, and deciding they like the way our western [military dress uniforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_uniform#/media/File:Household_Cavalry.jpg) look, right down to the sword and the medals, so they were going to go wear that to a party.  Not only would they probably get a lot of the details wrong, they're unintentionally pretending to be something they're not, and pretending to have earned an honor they haven't.

The other type of culture appropriation might be closer to what you're saying is ok, but I believe it's still a problem.

It's when people try to imitate a culture, but fail so miserably that they end up creating a caricature instead.  This is what you're talking about with things like ""Cowboys and Indians""  parties.

We can imagine what if people did the same thing with British culture.  What if everybody's idea of a British person was Dick Van Dyke's character from Mary Poppins, stupid accent and all?  What if every time you met someone, they had to make some stupid joke in a Cockney accent, because that movie was the only thing they knew about your culture?

Right now, that Dick Van Dyke stereotype exists, but it's different from more problematic stereotypes for one really big reason, which is that no one actually believes it's true, not really.  People have a huge amount of exposure to British culture, with TV shows, movies, news, and music made by British people introducing people to other aspects of British culture all the time.

The cultures that have problems with cultural appropriation don't have that big advantage.  Often the vast majority of the exposure they get is in the form of stereotypes, which means they're always fighting uphill against misconceptions and misunderstandings in order to actually give any sort of realistic information to others about their culture.  How much do you know about Native American culture from the United States that didn't come from old Westerns, bad Halloween costumes, or other culturally appropriated sources?",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of what cultural appropriation is and why it is problematic, using specific examples and analogies to help the OP understand the issue better.

"This is my first time encountering this quote, but tis is my interpretation:
This quote could be held as true only under the premise that ""religion"" in this case does not refer exclusively to theistic religions. Any system of rituals or beliefs that people follow, including the patriotic following of orders you referred to, is a religion in this context.

As for your other examples, they might be countered in a small variety of ways, depending on the interpreter's beliefs, including something like the following:
-Actions taken by a person in poverty in order to survive are not evil because the person has no alternative
-People who are drugged are not themselves, in that they are controlled by the effects of the substance or addiction thereto.","&gt;convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.

That depends. When do you define a person by their actions whether they're good and when do you define them by their ideology?

Indoctrination happens in mostly religious households and scenarios. Yes, political as well, but when it comes to beliefs and values I think religion does the indoctrination part a bit more. Especially with the whole ""hell if you don't believe"" idea.

I think that someone isn't a good person if they have an ideology I disagree with. I think nationalists are bad, fascists are bad and so on. So when it comes to ideology, they're not good people doing bad things, they're bad people doing bad things.

&gt;show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.

I mean it's all about interpretation.

""Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.""

He's certainly right when saying with or without religion, good people would do good things and bad people would do evil things.

Some actions aren't evil, yet aren't good either. So maybe good people could do bad things yet not evil.

Theft is an obvious example. It's not a good thing surely, and good people could do this whether or not they were religious, for different reasons. But it's hardly *evil*. Sometimes, theft is necessary or them to survive.

Can't really think of anything else to add here.

&gt;show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).

I suppose I already said what I thought on here.

&gt;anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

"Here is the important thing in my opinion: At least Steve is something new. Ellen Pao was a known quantity. She was a massively unpopular and shitty CEO. Steve Huffman is something new who at least has the *potential* to take reddit in a new direction. 

The issues that reddit has aren't with limiting free speech or monetization necessarily, but how massively poorly they were handled. Pao clearly didn't speak internet fluently and had no sense of the community of reddit. She seemed completely incapable of predicting the reaction of the community and responding appropriately. Steve, the *founder* of reddit almost undeniably understands and relates with the people and culture of reddit, and comprehends how it's people will handle certain changes. 

For example, there are ways to monetize reddit that don't suck and don't jeopardize the quality of the content. Paid AMA's, Facebook integration, autoplay videos, etc. are all things that the internet notoriously hates. It is also where I think Ellen would have gone based on her track record of thinking through a financial lens. Traditionally XYZ+ more $$$ in her eyes, so that's the path she goes down. But on a site like reddit, the consequences would be *massive* to do that, and probably result in a loss of traffic.

So the point is, Ellen Pao lacked a fundamental understanding of reddit, and it led to her being shunned by the community. Nobody felt connected to her on a personal level and she seemed like a money hungry cold person. A venture capitalist in a discrimination lawsuit is basically reddit's ideal punching bad. Pao was basically set up for failure. Steve seems to have less potential issues and would at least handle unpopular decisions more responsibly in the context of reddit/the internet.","I'd just like to leave [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3cik4o/inc_magazine_describes_paos_apology_as_a_madlibs/csw49ac) here which explains why lots of people dislike Ellen Pao. There is a common complaint that Ellen Pao is simply an asshole; and that is a perfectly legitimate complaint to have. There is more to the hatred of her than the decisions she made. For the lazy, the post is seen below (formatted links and formatted text not included):

------

This is Ellen Pao we are talking about. She was incredibly unprofessional. She'd just say ""fuck you"".

You all should really read the In a Trial brief on her alleged ""discrimination"" suit.

Her claims were so hilariously without merit it's amazing it went as far as it did. Not to mention that she was paid more than her male peers, warned multiple times about her behavior, didn't change her behavior, and was offered a very good severance package that she refused.

There is a reason reddit was the only place willing to hire her, and it wasn't because other firms were ""scared"" of backlash from Kliner Perkins.

Anyways, regarding Paos behavior, this is what her performance reviews said and what she said to the married guy she was screwing

Behavior page

Text message page

Then there is this article where she tried to justify her asshole behavior by saying everyone was an unprofessional asshole.

She literally made a ""resentment chart"" about everyone she hated at work. She had her own version of the Burn Book from Mean Girls
Another popular topic was ""asshole"" behavior at Kleiner Perkins.

Prompted by juror questions on her use of the phrase ""don't be an asshole"" in an e-mail to direct manager and senior partner John Doerr, Pao explained that it was a common saying at the firm, and referred to the need to show its portfolio companies respect — something, she says, the firm had issues with at times.

For example, she sat in on a meeting between two Kleiner Perkins partners and two startup founders about an potential investment. Not only did the two partners vocally declare they were passing on the investment right then and there, Pao says they started talking about finding the founders new jobs.

Also mentioned was a ""resentment chart"" that Pao had created, which listed all of the problems she had with various Kleiner Perkins executives. She said it was a personal document she had created to work through her frustrations.

""Once I wrote it down and got it out of my system, I got it out of my system,"" Pao said.

In response to a juror question asking if filing this lawsuit (instead of seeking a settlement) was a way to punish Kleiner Perkins, Pao had another brief soliloquy:

Litigation is painful and difficult. This has been three years of my life. My information is all public. My emails with my friends are public. All my emails are public. This is not a good process for resolving disputes. I wanted something meaningful so I could avoid all this. I wanted something so they couldn’t feel that women were at risk and treated unfairly. This is where we’re at because I couldn’t get them to take responsibility.

She's an extremely toxic person. she abused the system in order to try and get $$$ to cover the legal costs for her scumbag husband (who stole $144 million from the pensions of Louisiana firefIghters and police).

If people don't understand why so many of us dislike Pao, they haven't studied into the subject enough. False claims like that make it harder for individuals with real legitimate claims to get recognition. If assholes like Pao continue to abuse the system as a way to get back at bosses that had good reason to fire them it makes it more difficult for people that may have an argument they are legitimately being discriminated against to be taken seriously.

Her husband defrauded and stole from hard working public servants, and she is trying to help him. (Something blue collar workers would hate)
She abused the system set up to protect those from gender discrimination in order to further her own personal goals. She was also reportedly toxic to other females in the office. (something feminists, and SJWs should hate)

She tried to make false discrimination accusations after having a consensual affair with a married man, throwing the man under the bus. She claims to have been unfairly treated while making more money than her male peers. (something Meninists would hate)

She was extremely unprofessional and tried to get retribution against a former employer that gave her chances time and time again (something people in the executive business world would hate)

She got rid of employee negotiations because of a bullshit lie that ""women can't negotiate as well as men"" (something feminists and people in the working business world should hate)

She abused the legal system for her own personal gain (something anyone that hates frivolous lawsuits bogging down the court system should hate)

She took a site that was once centered around free speech and turned it into a censored shithole, with the ""safe space"" excuse only existing to help push it through (something many people that care about free and open debate should hate)

I could keep going on and on and on.

I've never seen someone do so many things to make themselves unlikable to so many people. Then people have the nerve to say we dislike her because she's a woman. Bullshit! We dislike her because her and her husband represent everything wrong with the business world today

TL;DR read the documents. Ellen Pao is unprofessional enough just to say ""fuck you"". She had a literal ""resentment chart"" made up about how much she hated everyone at work. It's actually impressive how many toes Pao has stepped on. It takes work to be that much of a slime bag human being.

"This is an interesting thought, but you're basing it on a premise that aliens will be roughly on the same technological level as we are. Seems more probable that either of us will be in the stone age relative to another. So, either they won't have the concept of constructed things, or our concept of robots will be on the same level as an useful sharp stick that makes animals become food.

What you might look into in this area is the Fermi Paradox (""Where is everybody?""). Basically, given the vastness of the Universe and the endless number of possibilities, there seems to be a significant chance of advanced alien civilizations being present; and it would surely be communicating and doing stuff on a large scale. But if so, how come we don't see any of that?

Some of the logical explanations actually fit the idea that all aliens might be on roughly the same level. Let's say something (Reapers or whatever) resets any life on certain intervals, so all civilizations had about the same start not a very long time ago. But there are other options. Like, there's no aliens. Or, the aliens are so different that we actually see them all the time but don't understand it.

Another way to look at this: we don't even know how consciousness works yet. That's the reason there's no AI (not the lack of processing power). For example, to make airplanes, people first tried to replicate birds, and failed at that. Then they made something entirely unnatural based on the science of aerodynamics, and it actually worked. So, we don't have this brain science. Some say there's even something beyond just mechanics involved. A soul or whatever. So who's to say it is even possible to make a true AI or digitize a person?","A robot is something very different from an non-organic, cybernetic creature. I thought your view was going to be similar to the premise of the X-Files episode ""War of the Corprophages,"" which suggests that much like we send robots to Mars, aliens will send robots (rather than their own people) to a place where we can make contact. I think THAT kind of ""robot"" is even more likely than the kind you've suggested.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more detailed and thought-provoking analysis of the topic.

"&gt; its supposed to be a journey where you explore other places and other cultures.

Okay, so I'm not going to get into a ""who said?"" version of this debate because that's pointless. I'll accept your premise. 

So what you'd argue is that my trip to Costa Rica is inherently more valuable than my trip to, say Dublin because I live in the United States. Fair enough. 

But here's my counterpoint: I am quasi-humiliated by my trip to Costa Rica because that shit was fucked up. Traveling to non-western (re: poor) countries is an incredibly morally murky process. It doesn't *have* to be but if you don't speak the language (one of your points) you're stuck with using industries that thrive off of Western travelers. And those industries can have a devastating effect on those areas. 

Now,we all can get behind the idea that going to Thailand to engage in sex trade is a pretty reprehensible. That's clear cut. But what about that beach resort in Mexico? Who's running it? Who profits? Whose working at it? Under what condition? What local industries/buildings/landmarks got bulldozed in order to capitalize on the beach front? 

Costa Rica is absolutely beautiful. But the culture is, with few exceptions, to be folksy for tourists. That's what people do. Much like parents who will amputate a limb of a child so they do better begging, this has some pretty serious consequences. No one is building anything. All the major infrastructure (the resorts, the tour packages, the skyride tours) was built by Western cultures. What's left for locals is to essentially pander to the tourists. And they *do*. And it is kind of sad. 

Yes, we spend money. I bought bracelets and sodas and magazines and candy. And that, I am sure, has a positive impact. But the net impact, the larger picture, is that the travel industry is pretty much holding people hostage because the money pouring in pours right back out to the people who invested in the infrastructure and only the dregs trickle down. We visited a very rural school and it was so striking because it was one of the only places we visited where we weren't being pandered to. 

**So here's my point**: Exploring other places and cultures is an inherently imperialist act. For more info, I strongly recommend reading *A Small Place* by Jamaica Kincaid. The idea you're espousing might actually be more imperialist, more harmful. At the end of the day I think there is value in experiencing other cultures and people, but I also know that MY gain comes at a price for their culture. It has to. But we don't talk about that. We focus on the small gains made by locals who profit off the travel money. We don't think about the bigger picture of who profits from travel and what is LOST in creating that infrastructure. Yes, if you go to rural Laos this is less of a problem, but who the fuck wants to vacation there. Even if you DID, how are you going to get around if you don't speak the language or have any help. That's simply not realistic for most people. 

But western tourism (visiting New York for example) doesn't come with the same moral quandaries. We are capitalizing off our own tourism. We're capitalizing off our own tourism in [Thailand](http://www.bangkok.grand.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html) as well, but we do so by swooping in and taking over. 

The whole ""value"" of experiencing other cultures? We're the ones that made that up.  Probably to sell hotel rooms. In Costa Rica.","&gt; If other cultures are so scary to you that youd save up thousands to go to a place where language and climate are the only differences from home youre probably a bit of a douche.

You seem to have a very narrow view of why people travel.  Many visit other countries to visit family, historical / architectural / artistic sites of interest, professionals in the same field etc etc etc.  

You will need to be a bit more specific as to why a person spending their money on a trip to a place that interests them makes that person a douche.

Also as an Australian I see plenty of people spend a couple of weeks on a tour in Thailand or hanging out at a retreat in Nepal (completely failing to immerse themselves in anything resembling the local culture). When these people then claim that they are 'better' than others for travelling somewhere non-Western - now that is being a douche.

"The ""argument from human nature"" gets brought up a lot but is surprisingly easy to refute. From all the socialist books I've read, (and I don't know if you've read any), it is never required theoretically that people should become perfect. Instead, socialism as a theory is conceptualised as one which will more perfectly fit human nature as it is. 

Firstly, what is human nature? The first thing we can say about it is that it is very varied. It is just whatever humans do. But humans do a lot of things. 

The central mistake that proponents of the argument from human nature make is a kind of ""begging the question"". They assume that human behaviour in a capitalist system must be the paradigm of human behaviour per se. I think this is demonstrably false, as a moment's reflection will show. 

For the vast majority of time that humans have existed, they were hunter-gatherers, living in fairly small communities or tribes and practising some form or other of primitive communism, ie, sharing the spoils of the hunt. Social structures were also more or less egalitarian, necessarily, because of required co-operation in the hunt. 

If mankind has a species character, it will be informed by being a hunter-gatherer, living in a social group. Other social forms, cities, states, capitalism, consumerism, and so on, are much later, much more recent developments. 

So what we can take from this about human nature? 1. Humans are a social species, they can collaborate and join their labour together for the common good. 2, Humans are creative, and find meaning and dignity in creativity. And you can also, more tentatively, add: 3. Humans are at their best when free to contract the kinds of social relationships and pursue the creative activities they want.

Well this exactly accords with the species character of man described by Marx and, before him, by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Man is given naturally to free, cooperative, creative labour. 

Now comes the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution transformed the farm worker into a factory worker, a proletariat. Labour became *necessarily* collaborative again. 

Socialism is nothing more, at a basic level, than a theoretical response to these facts about human nature and human creativity, and the facts of limited global resources and labour. If you want to, you can look at it merely as a rational, efficient use of resources and labour, getting rid of unproductive classes, middlemen, profiteers, production of useless commodities, and so on. 

So to sum up, your ""argument from human nature"" is, as usual when this argument is brought up, based on the usual question-begging and is, I'm sorry to say, based on something of a strawman socialism. I recommend that you read up on the topic and you'll see that no serious socialist writer demands or expects perfectibility. 

Your other objection, that socialism, in order to function properly, would require a world-wide system, is more serious and has more force to it.  But that was only ever a long-term goal and it doesn't follow that we can't try to achieve change in our day-to-day lives, and in our own local polities. After all, world-wide changes have been affected before and they will be again. 

I would also briefly say that very few people advocate a Soviet-style system these days. No-one is anxious to recreate the days of Stalin and gulags and show trials. But once you grasp that that was a deviation from the course of socialism proper, (and was recognised as such at the time by perceptive critics), the goals of socialism in the present day become all the more clear. ","&gt; then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers 

This why the  phrase ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" exists.

Ultimately, the biggest thing that can be done is to unite the working class. Join unions, negotiate better pay and working conditions for everyone the world over.

Obviously this is better achieved at a country level - but it can be expanded worldwide by those who are doing something in their own country, to (for example) only purchase or conduct businesses with other companies in other countries who are also improving the rights of their workers. Ultimately, everyone should be paid well for reasonable hours *regardless* of their job. And by ""well"" I mean a lot more than lowest earners are currently getting, by ""well"" I mean a wage that allows people to *live* and not work for little return.

This is achievable, and will have a real impact on the entirety of humanity. It will change the economy from that of an exploitative one, to one that promotes good pay for all, and allow us to live our lives, follow our dreams, and work in careers we wish to, instead of being wage slave until we die.

Right now there is a strike on the underground system in London. Instead of people supporting them in improving their work life, and using this as inspiration to improve *their* own work conditions and pay, people are attacking them. Calling them overpaid, greedy etc (when really the people who are doing the attacking and name calling are weak and powerless as they are too afraid to do the same thing - if someone has what you don't have, you should aim to get the same, not take away from what they have. This only makes things worse for everyone, including themselves,  as then being a low paying wage slave is the norm).

1) Young people don't vote. The showing for elections is pitiful, but especially among young people. And demographics show that the older you get, the more likely you are to vote. This is even more evident when the elections get smaller - when was the last time you voted for city commissioner? Probably never. But your grandma has in the past 5 elections.

2) Some people don't care about those things, and care about other things instead. The most obvious example is economics. Conservatives favor policies which are more favorable to business and economic growth than liberals. They support lower taxes, less regulation, and fewer worker's rights. If you are involved in running a business, or realize that you might lose your job (even your shitty, underpaid job) if your business loses its competitive edge, you will care far more about keeping the economy going strong than whether or not two men can get married in Nevada. ",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more detailed and nuanced explanation of why Republicans can still win elections, focusing on issue salience and the importance of certain topics like the economy over social issues. It also provides specific examples and data to support the argument. Response 2, on the other hand, relies more on generalizations and assumptions about the OP's personal background without addressing the core issues of voter behavior and issue importance.",0
"&gt;To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with ""crime.""

No

&gt;Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour.

It seems like the crux of your argument is that it is harder for men to sleep with women than it is for women to sleep with men, and since it is more difficult, it is more impressive and praiseworthy.

There are three main problems with your argument. First, I do not think your characterization of the ""stud/slut inequality"" is fair. When people complain that society treats men and women differently in this regard, it is not because women receive less praise than men. It is because women are met with scorn and hostility. If female sexuality was viewed as merely ""unimpressive"", I think that would be a substantial improvement. Your argument doesn't justify hostility, and so I don't think you have attempted to justify the main aspect of this inequality that people care about.

Second, your hypothesis has no proof. You could equally guess that women should in fact be more promiscuous than men, because they have an incentive to confuse the paternity of their children, ensuring support from as many men as possible. In fact, I think there is much more evidence here in favour of a social explanation. rather than a biological one. It is harder for people to sleep with women because society will criticize women who sleep with multiple people.

Most importantly, there is no obvious reason why a combination of difficulty and alleged biological incentive make something praiseworthy. There is probably some biological incentive to kill others- less competition for food and mates. It is certainly very difficult to kill someone. Is killing someone praiseworthy? Would we be justified in praising them?","Crime. You are correct in that it's harder for men to sleep with a bunch of women than a woman to sleep with a bunch of men.

The problem is you are attempting to shuffle off the ""Morality"" of women being promiscuous to another discussion, but at the same time you are saying that it's justified to call a woman a slut for doing it.

If you are going to say it's justified, we *have* to have that conversation as a part of this one. If the only reason we called women sluts was because it is easy for them to have lots of sex, then maybe we could ignore it, but you and I both know that isn't the reason.

It can't be justified to insult a woman for the same thing you praise a man for, unless you agree that women *should* be insulted for it. It's just not a separate issue.

"You have to remember that Pao is human too. Dealing with that kind of inhuman harassment is incredibly stressful and debilitating, and I can't blame her for stepping down. She's probably realized that being CEO of Reddit is not worth the absurd amount of strife she's faced from users who are, quite frankly, shitheads, but users who make up a vocal percentage of the userbase and users who have been relentlessly going after her (and, of course, many of these users are powerful enough with computers to make her life a never-ending nightmare).

"Those put on trial at Nuremberg were not rank and file soldiers; they were high-ranking officers. At that level, they were the ones giving the orders. No one was press-ganged into high-ranking positions in the SS. It was a largely volunteer force that that always had its pick of the most fanatical recruits. No one on trial at Nuremberg held the rank they held against their will.","So I'm going to answer this in three aspects - 

First, legally. The Germans surrendered unconditionally. That means the Allies were free to try the Germans in whatever manner the Allies desired. The ground rules for the Nurember trials wer set down in the [London Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Charter), which prohibited ""I was only following orders"" as a defense. (The Germans decided to use it as their defense anyway). I'd also like to point out that the British prosecutor at Nuremberg, Hartley Shawcross, went to great lengths to show that the trials were not a case of post hoc justice. That is, the Germans on trial at Nuremberg were guilty of many crimes under both German and international law predating the War. 

Second, as other people have said, the Germans on trial at Nuremberg were the top surviving leaders of Germany. 

Third, even if they were not high ranking, ""I was only following orders"" is not a legal defense for soldiers *at any level*, from the lowliest private to the highest ranking general. Soldiers have a duty to disobey illegal orders. 

&gt; You can't legally force someone to allow themselves and their families to die/suffer badly even if it means saving others lives

It's a shitty position to be in, but yes, we absolutely can expect that. If not, nobody would ever be guilty of anything. ",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more comprehensive argument by addressing the legal aspects of the Nuremberg trials, the responsibilities of soldiers to disobey illegal orders, and the moral implications of the situation. It also includes a direct rebuttal to the argument presented by the OP. Response 1, while informative, does not directly engage with the legal and moral complexities of the issue.",0
"While I agree that this is usually the best strategy, you have stated it more absolutely than is justified.

First: there's an alternate strategy that says you should always target the person who you think would be your (personal) toughest competitor, leaving the weaker opponents to survive. Sometimes this may override the advantage that dogpiling provides. 

That said... it really depends on what the sabotages are. I don't think there can really be any one perfect strategy that doesn't depend on specific situations.

Just to use a contrived example (but one which I have seen occur): One of your opponents forgot to get eggs in a baking challenge. You have a sabotage that removes someone's eggs. Under no circumstances should you give your sabotage to that person, even if they already have 2 sabotages assigned to them. Dogpiling would be the worst possible strategy in that situation.

There are many similar examples, such of them more subtle, such as someone that has already lost their knives being given a second sabotage that takes away ingredients that need to be cut, and replaces them with precut ingredients of lesser quality. 

Also, much of the time, the ""dogpile"" strategy doesn't really help, because very often the first sabotage equally effects all of your opponents. So at the very least, an *additional* strategy is needed beyond just ""dogpile"". And it's never helpful on the first sabotage.","I think its best to skip buying sabotages in the first round and save money for the later rounds. I've seen people blow their money too early and have no way to defend themselves in the later rounds. Also you help avoid revenge sabotages, the first round can be such a crap shoot and while the dogpile might ensure one person leaves, you don't know if you've dogpiled a strong chef or a weak chef and wasted money.

Now in the second round I could see this working. If you and the third chef realizes that chef #2 is very strong and adaptable, dogpiling chef #2 would be a solid strategy.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more nuanced perspective on the strategy of dogpiling in cooking competitions. It acknowledges that there are situations where targeting the strongest competitor or considering the specific sabotages can be more beneficial than a blanket dogpile approach.

"The politicians WOULD go for it.

Because potential success would be a HUGE publicity coup.

Heck, even failure would be a significant publicity coup, because politicians would get to talk about those brave astronauts who sacrificed themselves for a great goal.

You know what would not look good? Leaving Watney to die without apparently trying to do anything about it.

The politicians would have everything to gain by trying to save Watney, and almost nothing to lose.","A lot of space exploration missions are irrational from a purely economic perspective - but we do them because we learn things, and also because it means something great and intangible to us as a species. Since the money needs to come from the public purse, political will is the main barrier. In 1961, President Kennedy said that man would walk on the moon. With the political willpower in place, it happened, despite the fact that it was incredible expensive - overall the Apollo programme cost around $176bn in adjusted US dollars. Could that money have been spent better on R&amp;D? Maybe, maybe not - but ask any engineer or scientist who was alive at the time, and they'll say that it was 100% worth the cost - it is one of our defining moments in history.

You can bet your butt that in the book, the dudes in NASA would take every opportunity to promote the benefits of this mission to the politicians in order to ensure that the $$$ flowed. As soon as they saw that Watney's plight had captured the heart of the nation(s), the political will was there - just the same as Kennedy's 1961 mandate - and humanity went ahead with their plans. Look at how the whole world was united in a single purpose. In a way, the story was about mankind back on Earth overcoming barriers and boundaries in order to do something incredible as as whole species - while at the same time, Watney was overcoming his own issues on Mars.

Overall, we learn from failures as well as successes. NASA knows this, and if this had all happened in real life you could be sure that they would have learned a huge amount about living and working on the Mars conditions just through Watney's recounts of his experience - an invaluable amount of data which would have been lost.",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more in-depth analysis of the intangible benefits of space exploration and the importance of political willpower in achieving seemingly irrational missions.

"They posted it to appear on their friend's news feeds to be found serendipitously, not to browse all at once. That's why ""it showed up on my news feed"" is the classic defence to that.

It's like the difference between reading a magazine that has pictures of someone and specifically seeking out all the magazines you can find with pictures of that person, cutting them all out, and putting them in a scrapbook. (I'll concede that one is much more effort than the other, but I think the analogy holds)

It shows that you have a level of interest in that person that is disconcerting – you want to find out lots of information about that person and follow their life without their involvement, consent or knowledge.","You can't use the the fact that something is allowable online as justification for expecting people not to act negatively toward a behavior.  Especially when said behavior makes them feel uncomfortable.  If a person or persons views being researched online as a violation of boundaries, you either need to respect it or establish that you do not respect their boundaries.  While they might not be able to stop you, they certainly don't need to like or accept the behavior in a social context.  One way displaying displeasure with such behavior is to refer to it as ""creeping"" and those doing it as being a ""creeper"".

So another way to word your question is:  ""Do people have a right to be upset that I learned things about them I found they posted online?""  I say yes, why?  Because people have a right to their feelings, people establish social norms and boundaries and may be upset when someone violates it. 

First I much address:

 ""presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.""

You presume to much, something posted on social media does not imply that the poster means for it be information observed, retained, and reported by every single person who could find access to it.  It might not be secret, but it is not meant to be a conversation piece either.

If I go to a coffee shop and have a personal conversation with a friend about my Mother dying of cancer, it's not a secret conversation and people may over hear.  However if someone, even an acquaintance, comes up to me a month later and starts a conversation with ""I heard you talking about your dying Mom at Starbucks last April.""  I'm going to find it off putting, and likely consider that person a creep.  

The online world seems to become a place where people tell themselves that if a door is unlocked they are allowed inside.  If someone leaves a photo album open, they are allowed to open the book make copies of all the pictures and maybe using them in Photoshop later.  While legally, they are right with the second example, social norms in groups may have different rules.  These rules can change from group to group and you don't have to agree to them to be held to them in the eyes of the group.

Another thing to consider is that people not only take issue with the action of being researched, they also take issue with and are made uncomfortable with  idea of someone taking the time and effort to research them and see what is available about them online.  They may not be able to stop said activity, but they certaintly don't need to treat it as an acceptable for of social interaction.",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced argument about the boundaries of online behavior and the importance of respecting others' feelings and social norms. It also includes a strong analogy about overhearing a personal conversation in a public place to illustrate the discomfort that can come from someone researching online information about them.

Not only that, but most of these issues are due to an irresponsible policies on the Chinese government, which is really where the condemnation is pointed.

"&gt; inasmuch as how there is a justification for the government to take a larger percentage of your money because you earn more

This is a common misunderstanding of how marginal tax rates work.  If you make more money, the tax rate only changes on money made above the threshold.  This is an important distinction.

For example, in the US you pay 10% on earning up to $9,075.  Then you pay 15% tax on money made **between** $9,076 and $36,900.

So, someone who makes $10,000 doesn't pay a 15% tax rate.  There actual tax is 

* 10% on $9,075 = $907.50
* 15% on $925 = $138.75

For a total tax burden of 1046.25 or an effective tax rate of 10.46%","As a place to begin, I want to make sure we're discussing the same system here.  A graduated (or progressive) tax system does **not** punish you for earning more.

A simplistic variable system would look like -

- For the first $0 - $9,999 of income - Tax Rate = 0%
- For the income between $10,000 - $29,999 - Tax Rate = 10%
- For the income between $30,000 - $74,999 - Tax Rate = 20%
- For the income greater than $75,000 - Tax Rate = 35%

Keep in mind that if you make $15,000 in a year you aren't taxed 10% on the whole amount ($1,500) but rather 0% on the first $9,999 and then 10% on the remaining $5001 (for $500.10) so the resulting total tax paid in this example is $500.10

As you scale up the government does take more money... but your net income (after tax) *is also increasing*.  

As for why increased earners should pay more % tax - because they can actually sustain the loss.  All humans have the same basic requirements for life (ie Food, Clothing, Shelter) plus additional requirements (Transportation, Entertainment, Education etc.) that need to be met in some fashion.  While it is true that the rich tend to have larger expenses, a simple thought exercise leads to the conclusion that (unless your rich person is insanely overspending) as their income grows the total % of their income devoted to ""necessities"" as opposed to ""luxuries"" declines.  

By that logic, asking the higher income people to carry more of the burden makes sense - the people who are most able to sustain the loss are the ones taking the loss, while the people who are least able to sustain take the least loss.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of how a graduated tax system works and why it is fair for higher earners to pay a higher percentage of taxes. It breaks down the tax rates based on income brackets and explains how the net income still increases as earnings increase. It also argues that higher earners can sustain the loss better than lower earners, making it a fair system.",0
"Both sides are more obsessed with adhering to their identity than they are with helping either themselves or others. If leftists really cared about global warming and feeding hungry people, they wouldn't be so against nuclear power and GMOs. If rightists were actually concerned with personal freedoms, they would acknowledge that you can't have a lot of freedom without at least some redistribution.

Unless you are a politician yourself, it's really not all that helpful to think about this stuff in terms of right and left. Sometimes rightists are correct, sometimes leftists. Try not to become attached to a certain political identity, because it will make you more wrong. Your environment seems more left (since your view basically describes them as the good guys), so you should probably think more critically about leftist opinions.

&gt; When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away. They're basically worried that they won't be able to be better off than everyone else

Not really. Right-wing people tend to be more concerned with free markets than those on the left, but there's a good reason for that. In the world we live in, the free market is what brings prosperity. Regulating an industry could decrease the money a country makes and thus also the taxes they bring in. From a right-wing view, the best way to get more funding for whatever (say, helping the disabled) is to make sure companies make more money, because then they'll have to pay more taxes. 

&gt; When left-wing people are worried about right-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be able to survive without others helping and sharing. They are basically worried for their lives.

This is very much not the case. For the most part, left-winged politicians do **not** need to fear for their lives. They're roughly as well-off as right-winged politicians. And if you really think that left-winged people genuinely believe *they* wouldn't be able to survive, that's about as selfish as you can get: forcing people to help you so *you* can survive. 


I don't think the left-right dichotomy breaks down at ""selfish"" vs ""selfless."" It's a lot more complex than that, especially since there are so many people tying their identity to either side of this dichotomy. Look, for example, at how the right stands both for reducing government spending but also for increasing police funding and building more prisons. Those are both right-wing beliefs, but they don't really mix very well.

&gt; How can right-wing politics be reconciled with supporting and caring for ill and disabled people?

Most of right-wing politics does not support just leaving the ill and disabled out to die. (The most extreme stuff, like fascism, does, but hardly anyone sane supports that.) Right-wing politics rather believes that people know most about their own lives and will ultimately make the best decisions about how to live it. This includes how people allocate their resources (e.g. money and time). And they don't believe that people are basically selfish, because they honestly think that if you reduce taxes, people will give more to charity. Combine this increased funding for charity with an efficient free-market and you end up (in theory) with affordable healthcare for everyone. 

&gt; How do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives?

Do you genuinely believe that left-wing politics has never made anyone fear for their lives? The left's refusal to consider nuclear energy has probably killed a lot of people, because it led to more CO2 being pumped in the atmosphere. Somewhere in the world, people have been denied good medical treatment because the bureaucracy surrounding it went terrible (For example, the best treatment for my ADHD is something I can't afford because of the red tape surrounding getting your drug approved for government help in paying for it.)

If you're going to make statements such as ""right-wing politics literally cause people to fear for their lives,"" you're going to have to qualify what part of right-wing politics you are talking about, because there are plenty of right-wing policies that don't do that and a decent amount that makes people's lives better than their oppositional left-wing policies.

&gt; Are right-wing politics inherently selfish?

Sometimes, but not most of the time.","There are a lot of complicated and charged issues that you have bundled together. However, i think its necessary to clarify your conclusion:
&gt;It seems pretty obvious to conclude that right-wing politics are more selfish and dangerous than left-wing politics, based on what people are worried about.

I don't think its accurate to say that one political view is more or less selfish than the other. Politicians by nature must appeal to their demographic, every policy they espouse is inherently selfish in that they are designed to garner public support. A right wing politician supporting tax cuts is no different from a left wing politician looking to heighten benefit payouts. Each policy is equally selfish in its intention, the point of contention is which policy might give greater net-positive impact upon society as a whole. These are complicated matters where economics and social justice desires intersect. 

Another point i want to address is a right wing politician being ""more dangerous"" than a left wing politician. I think its fairly safe to dismiss this notion entirely. Firstly, the two party system which originated from the UK acts as a check on power. One is not inherently more dangerous than the other. More importantly, the principles of representative and responsible government ensures that politicians under the Westminster system can't enact dangerous policies without the implied consent of the people.

Hence, politician's on either side are not inherently more or less selfish than their counterparts. ",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more nuanced and balanced perspective on the issue, acknowledging that both right-wing and left-wing politicians can be selfish in their intentions.

"Seems to me that your position is built on the assumption that the religious view is factually incorrect, no? That seems to be the key issue here.

Let's say, for example, that I have a religious belief that if you have gay sex, it will cause a drought. And therefore I think we should ban gay sex.

What's really the important issue here. That my position is motivated by religion? Or that my position was factually inaccurate? To me, as an atheist, I actually don't care what the motivation for your belief is, whether it be religious or secular. I care about 2 things, in a very very simplified model:

1) Do I agree with the goal you are trying to achieve?

2) If so, do I agree that the means you advocate achieves that goal?

Taking the example above, I do agree that drought is bad. So we've passed step 1. But I don't agree that banning gay sex will alleviate the drought. Whether or not your belief that doing so comes from religious or secular just doesn't seem relevant.

Make sense?","I am not entirely sure what view you are attempting to have changed here. Either ""my religion states that drinking is wrong so for that reason I am fighting to make alcohol illegal"" is what you take issue with, or ""my religion states drinking is wrong, and it is more virtuous to abstain from drinking when temptation is all around you than to abstain when abstinence has been made the default legal option"".

The first one which is often tied to another topic which I don't want to start a debate about, could be construed in a few different ways. If drinking is such a reprehensible act and the ills it causes society are immeasurably horrific according to your religion, then doing everything in your power to prevent it from happening (in this case enacting legislation) could be considered moral and desirable. Further, if there are people who do not subscribe to your religion that take part in such a sinful exercise, while you may not be converting them to your religion (which is often the ultimate goal) you are at least preventing them from doing something that you view as wrong. 

Let's say we did live in a world where murder really was perfectly acceptable, but religion decided it isn't as great as everyone else thinks it is. If religion cannot convert everyone to that religion and their beliefs, would it not be at least a partial win for them to use ""secular"" powers for them to prevent murder? Would it not be dutiful/righteous of you and your religion to try to prevent everyone else from doing things you believe to be wrong?

For the second ""without temptation, abstinence is meaningless"" argument, people who have a religious conviction to avoid something typically put a great deal of effort into avoiding situations where they would encounter temptation. While alcohol may be freely available in some parts of the world, most people who have made a religious decision to avoid it do not keep it in the house to test their temptation. In largely religious communities/jurisdictions, it might not be commercially available, or at least you have to go out of your way to find it. They probably don't find themselves at craft beer festivals, taking winery tours, going to dollar pint night etc. all that frequently either. So while they might not be fighting for prohibition to be reenacted, they aren't actively seeking out alcohol in order to not drink it, and I doubt it would be considered good or righteous for them to be doing so. 

Are you suggesting that ""true believers"" would/should be testing their beliefs by regularly encountering temptation? Is that the best way to prove your faith?

Personally, I believe that if someone has a religious conviction against something then they are welcomed to believe that, but they should be accepting that others do not share their faith and thus their beliefs. That concept runs completely against most religions, as they tend to have some sort of ""share the good word"" or ""make others believe"" clause in there somewhere, but whether or not religion is a good or bad thing is not the topic of this CMV.

"Selfish means lacking in consideration of others. *The suicide person might not be thinking of others. The person whos calling the suicider selfish though is probably thinking of other people who will be harmed by this.

So, whether or not someone is selfish is really about whether or not their actions/advice only benefit themselves. *Suicide people might be only thinking about themselves and therefore might be selfish.

I personally think that everything people consciously choose to do is inherently selfish as they are carrying out their own whims, regardless of how their actions may or may not affect others. Because when it's all said and done even if what they did helped others and inconvenienced them it was still what they wanted to do so they were still just satisfying their own desires.

"A new single, gender-neutral pronoun could be introduced without falling into all of those traps that you describe. After all, ""they"" already basically fills this role, but some argue this is incorrect, and even if correct it is potentially confusing because that word can also be used as a plural pronoun. Simply replace ""they"" with ""whateverthefuckyouwant"" and all those problems are avoided.

Personally, I think gender-neutral singular ""they"" is perfectly fine, and trying to forcibly shoe-horn in another pronoun is pretty doomed to failure, because language isn't really a top-down process like that, but much more organic. But if it did happen slowly over time because people wanted a more unambiguous gender-neutral third person singular, it could happen without causing problems.","So...  I'm your target demographic here.  I'm MtF trans, but identify as non-binary.  I don't need a specific pronoun to describe my particular place on the gender spectrum; I'd agree that would be ridiculous--not because non-standard gender identities are ridiculous, but simply because of the way language works (that the meaning of a word must be known by both parties ub advance for a word to be useful in itself).  HOWEVER...

It would be nice to have a _singular_ gender-neutral pronoun instead of ""they.""  They is linguistically awkward because it's plural.  When I first came out, I decided to ask people to just use _she_, and one of the reasons for this is because there is no singular gender-neutral pronoun.  I agree that the proliferation of them is a problem, for me because it makes the adoption of one that's actually useful from a language perspective less likely.

I agree it's quite unlikely in the short term because we haven't settled on ___ONE___ of xe/ze/hir/etc... to describe non-binary gender identities.  But it certainly would be nice if it were possible in the long term (i.e., 30-50 yrs).",2,2,True,"Response 2 presents a more practical and realistic approach to the issue of introducing a new gender-neutral pronoun. The suggestion to simply replace ""they"" with ""whateverthefuckyouwant"" humorously highlights the potential absurdity of trying to introduce a new pronoun. Additionally, the acknowledgment that language evolves organically over time is a strong argument against the idea of forcibly introducing a new pronoun.",0
"Let me start by saying I'm a fan of Win *8.1* (the .1 being the key there).  And still appreciate what Win8 was trying to do.  So my arguments more or less here are to understand why there are a lot of people who hate it.  I think it's also worth mentioning that Win8 brings a lot of great things to the table (new explorer, new task manager, better under the hood performance, etc) but depending on the person, they probably don't care.

&gt; The main complaint seems to be the start screen replacing the start menu.

The problem is that it's considered a really jarring experience for a lot of people, and they don't like that.  So in order to access your programs in Win7 if they weren't pinned to the bar you could just open up the menu while still having a complete view of the desktop.  With Win8 however, going into the Start Screen completely tears you out of your working environment so you can access your programs not pinned to the bar.  So for some that only have a handful of programs pinned to their Start it's incredibly annoying to have an *entire* screen fill up your desktop rather than a small menu on the side.

Another issue (which I still kinda have with it, even though it doesn't happen often) is when you accidentally hit the Win key it pulls you out of whatever you're working on and into a completely different screen.  In Win7 if this happened all you'd see is the menu pop up and you'd just click off it to get back to work.  In Win8 you have to find the Desktop tile and click that, or strike the key again.  The process is non-ideal.

I also feel that it could have been executed a lot better as far as tile organization goes.  You can do two sizes, and stack them in a column.  I think they should have taken the ""snap to grid"" approach for icons on the desktop to allow you to stick tiles anywhere on the Start screen rather than just form columns and hope they align with your OCD.

&gt;  if you really hate it you can install something like classic shell to bring back to the start menu

I'm an advocate of this, however you have to remember that the majority of PC users are *not* incredibly bright.  So for instance if my father wanted to get a new laptop then he's got to figure all that stuff out on his own (not likely), I need to babysit him through the process on the phone, or I need to just do it myself.  And since it's a third party software, it's possible that it'll break for one reason or another in which case either he's got to fix it (not likely) or I need to fix it (annoying).

&gt; To change my view here you should tell me if there's something worse than the start screen in Windows 8 that makes it that bad. Or if the start screen really is that bad.

So depends on who you are.  I don't mind the Start screen but there are a lot of people who absolutely *loathe* it.

Other things wrong with Win8:

 - Charms menu.  Every time my cursor wanders over to a corner I get an annoying Charms menu pop up.  If I have a multi monitor setup (which I do now) if I *do* want to get to the Charms I have to balance my cursor between screens, making it nearly impossible to get on a single try.  It's also kinda useless.  I've nearly forgotten it's there on my desktop since all of its functionality is available elsewhere (at least from what I've used).
 - Lack of Start button (fixed with 8.1).  In Win8 there was no Start button, so the only way to get to the Start menu was hitting the Win key or going all the way to the corner with the cursor.  Annoying.
 - Shut down (fixed in 8.1, kinda).  In Win8 if you want to restart/shut down/sleep it's a several key/click process.  You need to get to the start menu, then open the charms bar, then select settings, then power options, then select what you wanna do.  It's a kind of hidden process, and really annoying if you don't know how to do it.  Once you do know, you think ""why is this a several step process when it should be like Win7?"".  Win 8.1 *kinda* fixes this by allowing you direct access with a right click of the Start button, or directly on the Start Screen.  I say *kinda* because a right click is non-ideal and non-obvious and putting it on the Start screen means you still need to use the Start Screen.
 - Direct to Start Screen on boot (fixed in 8.1, with a settings change).  Booting up goes right to the Start Screen rather than the desktop.  Annoying.  Fixed with a settings option in 8.1, but it should be default.
 - Full screen apps (kinda fixed with 8.1).  Full screen apps on a desktop (or even laptop) are a terrible idea.  Win 8.1 kinda fixes this by docking them on the taskbar, but full screen apps are still a terrible idea.  They need to be windowed or the option to have them windowed, period.  For someone who wants to look at more than one thing (laptop and desktop users) having Mail taking up your entire screen is a drag.
 - General hidden features.  Things that should be obvious are hidden.  You need to hunt a corner to pop a menu out, accessing ""all apps"" from the Start Screen there's a *hidden* arrow button, right clicking contextually to find things (like the shut down point before) etc.  Not to mention all the stuff buried in the Charms bar.  There's too much hidden stuff that's only nice if you already know where it is.
 - General touch-oriented approach.  A lot of stuff is designed with touch in mind, like the Tiles.  Great if you have a touchscreen, and janky looking if you don't. 
 - Too much tied in with MS.  They really try to get you to make an MS account, and tie your login with said account.  I absolutely hate that.  It makes things like Onedrive on the desktop inaccessible because of this integration, as opposed to just having the application take whatever credentials it needs.  If you chose to shirk making and signing in with an MS account, you lose some of the perks Win8 brings to the table.
 - Multiple PC settings areas.  So you've got the standard Control Panel, then you've got this ""Settings"" area that has some repetition from Control Panel, then some other stuff not in Control Panel that should be integrated into just Control Panel.  It's also a full screen app...ughhhh.  So if you wanna set something, you have to hunt through an already kinda cryptic Control Panel, but also through this new Settings app.
 - Repetition of functionality.  There's a lot of different ways to do one thing.  Shut down is yet again an example of this.  Device management is another (Control Panel, Settings app, Charms bar).  Search is another (Win+S, Start menu then type something, Charms bar).  There is way too much repetition.

So all in all, if you're not a savvy user (like most) then updating is a real pain in the ass.  8.1 does fix a lot of flaws 8 had, and Win10 supposedly brings a lot of that stuff even closer to Win7 (Start menu).  Win10 is what Win8 should have been.

And in reality, there's ways around just about every nit up there.  Problem is, that if you have to find a way around something in order to get to experience the better things and improvements Win8 has to offer then that's a bad thing and deserving of a lot of the hate that Win8 has garnered.","In 1994-1995, there were a bunch of ""alternative shell"" programs launched for Windows 3.1. Most prominent among them were Microsoft Bob and Packard Bell Navigator.

They were intended to make computers simpler, friendlier, easier to use thanks to more familiar UI elements.

They were a massive failure, in part because their supposedly-intuitive UIs were anything but, and in part because they were so limited—a lot of functionality was buried, you had no idea what you could or couldn't interact with or what anything would do, and you just couldn't do certain things without exiting the ""friendly"" UI and returning to the real OS.

Windows 8 is that, but worse. It's grafted into the OS, rather than merely overlaying it. It's mostly ignorable, but there's just enough designed-for-touchscreen elements (which are explained... once... the first time the computer ever turns on while running that version of Windows) that are vital to day-to-day life that you can't just pretend it doesn't exist. Like the Charms menu in order to reboot or power down, or tying the native web browser and SkyDrive to the new ""modern"" UI, or the nightmare that is trying to sort the start screen. Even if you like the new start screen—I personally think it looks pretty nifty—it's not really very *good.* (I always preferred Launchy to the Start Menu, so that wasn't a problem for me, but it's certainly a problem for a lot of other people.)

And that half-baked, Frankenstein's monster of a solution was really a shame. I liked Windows 8. I still like Windows 8, and I'm looking forward to Windows 10—the improvements to network file sharing code, file move/copy, the task manager, and overall RAM use are all really good benefits, and bumping my work computer from 7 to 10 is going to be a delight. But 8 was badly-designed software, even if you could ignore most of the bad parts if you knew what you were doing.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more balanced view of Windows 8, acknowledging its flaws while also highlighting its positive aspects. The response also addresses specific issues with the Start screen and other features of Windows 8, offering solutions and workarounds.

[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)

[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)

Both of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds. They propose that your effect on meat production is a measurable probability.

In other words, they ask questions like, ""What are the odds that your purchase of, say, a frozen turkey will be the one that causes your grocery store to order another entire shipment of frozen turkeys? And that that shipment causes the food distributor to order more turkeys? And that that shipment causes a farm to slaughter more turkeys?"" 

The number of animals produced and slaughtered is so high that the very small probability of you sparing an animal from it still translates to 50-100 animals per year. And in my opinion, that's significant.

Think of it this way: If the odds of you saving one animal are the same as the odds of you winning the lottery (say, one in 200 million), being a vegetarian is like entering that lottery a billion times.","I agree with /u/huadpe that simply the act of being vegetarian/vegan makes it easier for other people to reduce their meat consumption, because as the population of vegetarians and vegans expands, restaurants are offering more and better vegetarian/vegan options, including some that are so tasty only the most rabid carnivores would turn their nose up at them. The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn't worth eating.

Helping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles. (I'm not sure how that figure was calculated, but if it's even close to correct, it demonstrates the kind of difference skipping meat just three meals a week could make.)",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more holistic view of the impact of veganism/vegetarianism, focusing not only on the individual impact but also on the societal and environmental impacts. It presents statistics and examples that show how reducing meat consumption can have a significant effect on greenhouse gas emissions and overall environmental health. This broader perspective may be more convincing to the OP as it appeals to a sense of responsibility towards the planet and future generations.",0
"Really, to say ""there is only black and white"" is just as wrong as saying ""there is no black and white - only grey"".

Because if black and white exist - grey must also. And if grey exists, so must black and white! You can't have grey without it's mix of black and white.

What a person sees - whether black/white/grey (or roygbiv!) is a function of their knowledge and understanding. They might claim there is no black and white for a number of reasons. If what is right or wrong to them seems morally confusing, they might say black and white don't exist - because that's what life feels like to them. Or if a person believes he is not the cause of his actions he might say black/white don't exist, believing that life is a series of predetermined or random events we have no control over. Or a person might believe philosophically that right and wrong are all a matter of subjective or cultural perspective.

There *are* plenty of difficult choices with moral implications to make in life that you will not immediately know what the right thing to do is. E.g. should you live with your father or mother if they split up and you believe you love them equally? What's the right thing to do? For the moment of uncertainty, you may acknowledge the existence of grey.

Now to your example: if you have exhausted all other options and your baby is dying, should you steal to save it's life? 

You said that stealing was bad/black, and saving your baby was good/white. Are you sure? You can't morally evaluate a particular choice *in isolation* of the context, the reasons, cause and effect, means and ends. 

In a certain context like in this example, stealing *is* the absolute, objectively right *moral* choice. Stealing is *right*! (Others may call it grey - you may call it black. But I believe it's 100% objectively white). In an emergency context, what is right and wrong must be re-arranged as a temporary measure so that the good survives. Of course, after the baby is saved, the father is still morally obliged to pay back what he has stolen.




","The Universe can't be divided into good and bad because 'good' and 'bad' are just descriptions of how parts of that universe, interact with humans on a subjective level.



By that I mean that 'bad' means about the same thing as 'soft', or 'warm to the touch'. Warmth and the softness of something is really just a description of the subjective feeling that object has in its interaction with humans. 

We can express this interaction in more complex ways, and we can measure and relate this feeling to other, less subjective criteria, like:temperature for warmth and coefficient of friction/ and description of material surface and its interaction with other materials. 

But in the end, we're just relating two physical properties of bits of the Universe, with the subjective feeling that we experience, as a physical organism.


Now the above examples are much more wishy-washy, because of the fact that something like warmth *is* able to be objectively measures by an accurate outside source, like temperature. Good and bad are just the two general categories of 'responses' that we lump things in. Getting stung by a bee feels bad, and causes pain, swelling and a sometimes dangerous interaction with an outside chemical that you're body has a conditioned, negative-reinforcing experience to.

Most people would be comfortable in firmly putting 'being stung by a bee' under the 'bad' response category. But what about something more complex, and subtle? Like a tickle? The exact same sensation could be pleasurable, infuriating, hilarious, sexual, annoying and downright maddening, all based on the (very,very,very) complex interactions happening in your brain, which we call consciousness.


Is tickling bad, or good? Well answering which category to put that in could be either an easy choice, or a very difficult one, depending on any brains subjective and unique experience of it.




From these examples we can see how the idea that there is no middle ground between good and bad, is comparable (and in some ways I'd say, much *more* incorrect) than saying something like ""There is no middle ground between cold and hot"". 

Of course there are things so hot you'd physically be unable to experience them without instantly rendering your mushy and organic sense organs useless and dead, and of course there are things so cold that it would instantly begin killing and freezing any sensing cells it came into contact with.


But isn't it also obvious that, due to the fact that the transition between warmth and cold is a continuous scale, and the criteria is inherently subjective (Note: I'm talking about warmth, as in the sensation, which while highly correlated to temperature, is not the same thing), than the same must be true for good and bad, and thus there exists a very large grey area while attempting to jam everything into those two categories.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more concrete example and scenario to illustrate the point that there are situations where moral choices are not strictly black or white, but rather exist in a grey area. By presenting a scenario where stealing to save a baby's life is argued to be the morally right choice, it challenges the notion that everything can be neatly categorized as good or bad.",0
"How is volunteering incompatible with narcissism?  There are plenty of narcissistic [voluntourists](http://www.utne.com/Politics/The-Dark-Side-of-Volunteer-Tourism-Voluntourism.aspx) helping out in all sorts of worthy endeavors.  A selfie picking up trash can be far smugger than a selfie dancing and celebrating.

By all means, volunteer - good deeds are good.  And by all means, be humble and modest.  But I don't think that volunteering inherently creates modesty.  Finding a way to modestly show solidarity is a very tricky needle to thread.  It's certainly compatible with volunteering, but I don't see the two as linked.","Based on this belief should individuals that attend any parade that doesn't specifically target them be required to volunteer?

"I won't argue about abortion, but your feelings about your stance.

I make it a point to respect opposing beliefs, as long as the belief makes sense and is thought out. I'll rarely respect an argument against gay marriage, because that is discriminatively denying what should be a basic human right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 

Abortion is a very complicated topic, though, and I can understand why someone would be against. Disliking the idea of ending a life before it makes sense is totally fair. I disagree with your position, but I get why you have it.

And your opinion is not an asshole opinion. Unlike prohibiting gay marriage, banning abortion isn't trampling over liberties or discriminating. You could make the argument that it's telling a woman she isn't allowed to have control over her own body, but I'd argue that it doesn't reach the same extent. Now, this is certainly to a degree apples and oranges, and not the perfect comparison, but do you understand what I mean? Furthermore, you admit to yourself that you aren't in a position where abortion would matter to you. You know that you have a lack of perspective shaping your opinion. 

And just because you agree with Redditors on some things doesn't mean you have to agree with them on everything. They're *your* beliefs, and nobody can tell you that if you believe A, you have to also believe B and C. Sure, a party platform might indicate support for all three, but you believe what you want, regardless what other people have outlined. 

You aren't saying women are subordinate beings. You aren't calling pro-choice people heathens. You aren't being a dick about your beliefs. They are thought-out, and you believe them for a reason. And there's nothing wrong with that.

I disagree with it, but I won't attempt to change your view on abortion. But you *are* wrong about feeling like an asshole for it. ","I honestly don't know anyone who is pro abortion. It's a sad and traumatic thing to choose to do, and I'm not sure it's something I would ever choose for myself. 

But not for one second do I think my choice not to have an abortion should affect someone's hard choice to have one.

When is it okay to limit a woman's right to do as she wishes with her own body? 

A women's right to control her reproductive organs should not end the moment someone sticks a penis inside her. 

It shouldn't end when he ejaculates, it shouldn't end just because she happens to be ovulating, or because an egg is inseminated. So when should her rights be limited with respect to her choice to abort the pregnancy? When should the rights of a fetus outweigh her right to choose her own destiny? 

Obviously by the time she gives birth, that fetus has full rights to life. But when did they start? Did the child's rights to life gradually come into being, or were they switched on suddenly?

I think that the fetus should only be deemed to have rights when it could theoretically survive even if the mother tragically died.  Only at this point do I see any point in supporting a fetus' rights. Before this it is too much a part of its mother to survive on its own and therefor too much a part of its mother to have rights separate from hers. 

So do I support abortion? No. Do I support it being legal? Absolutely! 

Also, I'm a man so who gives a shit what I think. ",1,2,False,"Response 2 presents a logical argument for why a woman's right to choose should not be limited, focusing on the point at which a fetus should be considered to have rights separate from the mother.

"A scientist is an expert in a science. I think that's a fair definition of  scientist we could agree to. Now the question is is he an expert?

"&gt;Andrew Wakefield 

Wakefield's claims were fraudulent. The journals that covered his articles pulled them after it was discovered that he accepted money from interested parties. He actually lost his medical license over it. 

Thompson's findings only showed an increased risk after multiple subset limitations. This makes the conclusion highly unreliable (the raw data did *not* support a link between Vaccines and Autism).

There is a vast medical consensus that vaccines are safe and effective. The fact is, there really isn't a controversy in medically knowledgable spheres. It's only the uneducated, following charlatans that has created an *illusion* of controversy (in a very similar manner to climate change deniers). Always look at *where* the controversy is coming from.  

&gt;There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.

Research some of the diseases these vaccines cured and then talk about ""horror stories"". The rare harm that vaccines cause is far outweighed by the elimination of the diseases.

That's not to say that the vaccine (and larger medical) industry is entirely without issue, but there is no reputable organization that doubts a) the effectiveness of vaccines or b) the general (not perfect) safety.

It may be helpful to know what exactly you think is wrong with vaccines, so we can narrow the articles we show you.","&gt;  Between whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.


The problem with this argument is that it is open ended and not grounded in a fact or idea.  It is as hard to dispute it as it is to dispute the comment *""I am scared""*.  

Whistle-blowers are essential to keep groups honest.  It doesn't mean that the whole system is better off gone.  It only means that there are more flaws than an entity would otherwise acknowledge.  I'm not familiar with everyone on the list, but considering that Obama immediately granted William Thompson immunity from any crimes for testifying clearly indicates that we're not looking at a conspiracy. He spoke out and he was encouraged to do so.

&gt;  Now I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.


As /u/amazingmrbrock pointed out in what might be deemed *the laziest CMV comment in history* there's more at stake than what you can plainly see.  Specifically Herd Immunity.  That means that we are communally protected from diseases because they are less prevalent.  So for instance, babies younger than 1 year old or the elderly with weakened immune systems may not be able to be vaccinated.  However the lack of prevalence of the disease in society makes it that they are still safe.  So being vaccinated is not just about saving your life but it is about saving the lives of others around you.


Separately, it is important not to look at public policy from an empirical perspective.  Everyone will always know of a story about someone who suffered in some way.  This only points out that a system is not perfect, which was never really in contention. The only question is if the system is better than the lack of a system.  Which *statistics* do a much better job at proving.  Looking at the [Anti-vaccine Body count](http://www.antivaccinebodycount.com/Anti-Vaccine_Body_Count/Home.html) we can see staggering numbers in preventable diseases and deaths.  

If vaccines caused autism or had similar effects, then surely it would be measurable in a similar way.  We could reconcile that data against each other.

On the other hand, there's no doubt an art to making music for mass consumption.  It may not be the type of art that you particularly enjoy.  It may not be the type of art that I particularly enjoy.  But it's an art that takes a tremendous amount of skill, expertise, and talent nonetheless.

In other words, country may seem formulaic, but if you thought it could be easily replicated you'd be out making millions and banging groupies right now.

When I hear a popular radio song that doesn't fit my taste, I've learned to appreciate it by listening for what it does that has made it rise about the countless number of other songs people hoped desperately to be as popular.  For example: the song I'm listening to may have dumb lyrics, but they're lyrics that still appealed to people in some profound way that other, similar songs did not.  Or the song may have a cheesy hook, but what is it about that hook that made it so popular?  That sorta thing.","It seems that you are mostly only familiar with pop country, which is the country commonly put on the radio.  It has the same problems of general pop music in that it is very repetitive and formulaic as the goal is not to make good music, but to sell music.  However, if you ignore the radio, it is fairly easy to find good country music.For me, I enjoy the subgenres of folk and bluegrass.  

[Here is a good example of bluegrass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6kihlmvAfQ).  Notice that it doesn't even need lyrics and relies entirely on the sound of the instruments.  [Bluegrass also can use vocals, such as this one about a river where the signer grew up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCDHxPzrHgo)  Sometimes, a band might also [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMrAbPSUhA4) existing songs from [other genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c7bISLhVl8).

Folk you don't often see much originality in terms of lyrics, as it is often involves taking an existing song and putting your own spin on it (compare these [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28Bq_2soGIA) very different takes on the [same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaS3vaNUYgs) song).  [Here is an example that omits the lyrics, but is still highly recognizible to anyone familiar with it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFyvxxsm7RQ)  In terms of relation to other genres of music, American folk music is very closely tied to [Scottish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k9YWf9gWaA) and [Irish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE9l2p0kLKk) folk music, to such an extent that they will [often blur together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuwzsFAFllA).

I did have a comment about a year ago on a similar topic that was well received, but as you have posted a slightly different argument (focusing on currently produced music rather than the genre as a whole) I have tried to tailor this argument more towards your opinion.  [However, there may be something I said or posted in the previous thread that might sway you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1tjzsv/cmv_that_country_music_is_boring/ce8scdg)

"There's things about privilege here. As I'm sure you've read, and probably recoiled from, like it's easy to do. I have.

So gender is a construct pushed on us by society. It's a made up thing, lots of societies have words for more than the two genders we're given. 

The argument lots of people give is that race is also a construct pushed on us by society. It became *a thing* when poor people started getting on too well and the rich needed some way to separate them and stop them fighting against the things keeping them down. That's true. But that doesn't mean experiences  of oppression are the same.

Someone not feeling the gender they are told they are experiences lifelong oppression. Because it's a made up thing, but you're told you can't act a certain way, or wear certain things etc etc etc. 

A white person doesn't experience lifelong racial oppression in America. They never have. They may feel very close to black culture, but when it comes down to it, society doesn't oppress them for their perceived race. Society won't see them as something different to *white* if they like *black* music, or clothes, or culture. 

If someone likes something other than what their expected gender norms are then they are put outside of those norms. And seen as, and treated as, different. This isn't the case with race.

So to be trans is one thing. Because although gender is a societal construct, you experience lifelong oppression based on the breaking of that binary norm.
To say you're black? You haven't experienced lifelong oppression based on breaking that societal norm. And that's not even getting into cultural appropriation etc.","How about all her black experiences with racism like [her black dad who was harrassed for living in the South](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxQl6nZRw40)?  So just like black people, she makes up bullshit stories of racism to garner sympathy and to strengthen the power of the race card whenever she chooses to use it.

"Coutner-point: there are some professions in which it is perfectly acceptable to not feel satisfaction in what I do but it is definitely still worth doing.

While it is definitely possible to feel satisfaction in doing one's job as a soldier, a great number of soldiers have also described the job of war as immensely unsatisfying and depressing (as they should- while we might feel good about a defense of our homeland, we should definitely have the satisfaction tempered by what the situation has come to). 

An even more extreme example would be an executioner- perhaps you can find a form of non-sadistic satisfaction he can have in his job (perhaps enforcing justice?).

But the point definitely stands- there are times when agents acting as the arm of the broader society have to engage in horrific actions, and it becomes harder to justify your statement.","I think feelings of satisfaction and wellbeing are internal states not directly cause by our job performance. While I agree people should feel satisfied, I don't think the job is the problem. Satisfaction is an internal state.

"The problem with both the prison-industrial complex and your proposed solution is that both are guitly of kicking the can down the road: the punitive encarceration of people who break the law often leads them to be *less* able to rejoin society and to change course from a life of criminality. This is caused by institutionalization, things like long-term isolation, being victimized sexually, physically, and mentally while an inmate, and especially the restrictions and difficulties which newly released ex-cons have to face.

It's very difficult for an ex-con to get a job and a place to live in, *especially* in an area that is reasonable and which doesn't have lots fo crime. So they get stuck in a shitty job working for the minimum wage, most likely living in a shitty neighborhood where they may be exposed to crime. It's basically a recipe for failure. If you got busted for drug dealing then you're stuck working in a factory making no money and being treated like shit, wouldn't you want to go back to selling drugs so that you could make a reasonable living in a n occupation that doesn't require a clean criminal history?

But you already know this.

The problem with your idea of public shaming and exile is similar. People are publicly humiliated for the crimes they commit, so *everybody* in the community knows about what they have done. They will essentially be outcast, just like an ex-con in the example above. This will lead to more criminality as well.

And as for exile? Well, if that ain't the worst kind of kicking the can down the road then I don't know what is. Pushing criminals out of your community into someone else's is terrible NIMBYism. Exiles will likely end up gravitating into what amounts to a social leper colony. There's no jobs, there's no way to contribute to society, there's only other criminals around you who are all just as down on their luck. That sounds like a college for criminal learning and a recipe for creating gangs.

So what are these two alternatives really missing? 

Well, I've already explained the problem of not having a rehabilitative goal for incarceration or exile. And that's a huge problem. Another problem is that there's no restorative justice &amp;mdash; a person burns down a building then gets kicked out of society. What good does that do for the person she is left with a smouldering foundation? It's better to put the guilty party to work *rebuilding* what they burned down because then they have to face the consequences of their actions and they have to face up to the building's owner and the hardships that their actions have visited on this person.

The other problem with exile is that &amp;mdash; and I truly believe this &amp;mdash; there are some people who are not capable of rehabilitation. It isn't many people, but there is some small slice of the population which are unrepentant psychopaths and child molesters. Basically they *need* to stay in a place where they can't cause more damage to society. That doesn't mean locking them up in a dungeon or in permanent solitary confinement, but by the same token exiling them would condemn another community to go through the same horrors as yours did.

*Edit*: also ""democratic punishment"" sounds a *lot* like mob justice. Look at what reddit did when they tried finding the Boston Marathon bomber. There needs to be someone/some people who are somewhat impartial or otherwise people will be found guilty before there's even a fair justice proceeding to establish who did it and why they did it. (I don't think that our current pay-per-justice system is the right approach to this, but I still believe that in many ways it's better than mob justice). P. S. Hello, comrade!","We already do exile people for certain offenses, namely sex offenses. That's the entire point of the sex offender registry. It ensures any individual on it will never own a home, live in a town of any significant population, or work a job ever again. It's publicly available and there are no shortage of websites dedicated to listing people on it.

Of course, being an ex-con in general exiles you from society to varying degrees. Many jobs become permanently off-limits to you, as does housing and education opportunities.

As for public shaming, we do that already too. Read your local newspaper. There's almost certainly a column dedicated to showing the pictures and details of everyone arrested that week. Courts are usually open to the public as well.

Shunning is inherent with all of these actions. Most people don't want to associate with a felon.

So since we already do these alternatives, we already know the results, and they're pretty bad. As it turns out, cutting people off from opportunities only makes them *more* likely to offend. After all, if you went to prison for dealing drugs, met a bunch of other drug dealers and suppliers there, then get out to find most jobs and learning institutions won't even look at you anymore, do you settle for a months long search to find a crappy minimum wage job, or do you use your prison connections to forge an even more lucrative drug dealing career than what you had before?

As for exile, like in the case of sex offenders, it's really bad. By giving these people nothing left to live for, you've removed all incentive to act on good behavior. There is going back to prison, but if you're homeless and off the grid how are they going to find you? With that ankle monitor you took off?

As for shaming, it can be psychologically traumatic (which will do anything but make a person less likely to offend). The founding fathers were expressly against it as a form of justice as they considered it cruel.

But what about deterrence? Studies have shown that the severity of punishments has rapidly diminishing returns on deterrence factor. In other words, you do need to make sure that the punishments aren't so trivial that people consider them nothing to be worried about, but beyond that it doesn't matter. Why? Criminals don't really consider the potential punishments when committing crime. Either because it's something down impulsively without much thought, or because they think they won't get caught so why worry about the punishments?

Finally, many of inmates in the US corrections system have severe psychiatric illnesses. These people aren't served by being in prison, and they wouldn't be served by other forms of punishment either. What they need is psychiatric treatment, or possibly long-term institutional care (ie living in an asylum).",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of the flaws in both the prison-industrial complex and the proposed solution of public shaming and exile.

"What's your definition of ""societal cohesion""? If you define the term such that ""less crime"" = ""more cohesion"", then sure. But I don't think anyone disagrees with such an obvious point; we all agree that men commit more crime.

If you define it in any way that doesn't make your view painfully obvious, then I'm not so sure. Basically what you're saying is ""any group with an above average crime rate is detrimental to social cohesion"". Well, that would imply the populous of California and Texas are all detrimental to social cohesion, since they have above average crime rates. However, I doubt anyone would agree with such a notion, unless you define social cohesion in a weird way.

I mean, let's think about the logic you're using and apply it to other groups. People aged 18-65 also have an above average crime rate when compared to the general population. Does that mean people of this age are detrimental to social cohesion? Again, probably not, unless you define ""social cohesion"" very strangely.

"This would be well outside the norm of how we sentence people.

In the case of swatting, we're talking about 2 crimes:

Reckless endangerment and filing a false police report.

In NY (my state), this would be reckless endangerment in the first degree, which is:

&gt;A person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the first degree when,
under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, he
recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to
another person.
Reckless endangerment in the first degree is a class D felony.

As a violent class D felony, this would carry a minimum sentence of 2 years, and a maximum sentence of 7 years.

If a person did in fact die during the raid, they'd be guilty of manslaughter in the second degree, defined as:

&gt;A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when:
    1. He recklessly causes the death of another person; ...
Manslaughter in the second degree is a class C felony.

As a violent class C felony, this would carry a minimum sentence of 3 1/2 years, and a maximum sentence of 15 years.

The above would be possibly increased if the defendant has prior convictions - those all assume no priors.

To get to the length of sentence you're talking about, we would need to upgrade them to class C (in the case of reckless endangerment) or class B (in the case of manslaughter).  But we start bumping into some irrationality then.

I don't think swatting, without physical harm done, is the same severity as manslaughter.  Manslaughter is a really serious crime.  And if you want to upgrade the punishment if it becomes a manslaughter, then you're talking about punishing it like a murder (murder is a class B felony, sometimes class A).  But it isn't as serious as a murder.

Swatting can be severely punished.  The crimes above carry substantial sentences.  A conviction for 1st degree reckless endangerment (which swatting is), has a mandatory minimum prison sentence, so it's not like you can get off with a slap on the wrist.

But decades in prison is essentially reserved for murderers, rapists, and serial criminals.  And it should be.  /b/tards aren't as evil as murderers.","The kid you've linked to in that news article is 17 right now. You're saying he should face decades of imprisonment for what he's done... now think about that, really.

If you lock him up for 20 years, he'll get out when he's 37; for 30 and he'll be 47; for 40 and he'll be 57 years old. We're talking about a child's life here. Granted, what he did is undoubtedly wrong, and I cannot imagine being a victim, having a SWAT team in full gear and weaponry busting down your family's door has to be one of the scariest experiences I can think of. That said, this is still a 17 year old child. A moron really, if only by age. Can you imagine the person you were 10 years ago, and how different you were? Or the person you were in high school? This is just some idiot kid who thought he was pranking people. Put him away for 5 years, that's still a massive amount of time, but when he gets out you'll more than likely have someone who is truly sorry.

He'll have never finished school, gotten any job experience, he's already got this criminal record, he'll be getting into his older years so finding companionship will be much more difficult...

"I really don't think it's possible to ""change your view"" on this, because ""creeping"" is such an ambiguous word.

There is definitely a colloquial use of ""creeping"" that doesn't imply anything negative. Also, it's frequently thrown around in a sarcastic manner, or simply as a joke. 

This really has to be broken down into a case-by-case basis, and even then, you might just be misunderstanding somebody.

I will say that I think ""creeping"" is thrown around more casually these days in that specific context because of the ubiquity of social networks. *Everybody* has a Facebook page, and most people have so many Facebook friends that 80% of the content their friends post never even makes it to their timeline.

So with that in mind, depending on what specifically you mention as having seen on somebody's Facebook, that almost automatically implies that you put in an effort above and beyond simply becoming Facebook friends and passively monitoring your own personal timeline. It may be a trivial amount of effort, but if somebody becomes aware of the fact that you actively searched through their profile in particular, it is unsettling to some degree... again, this is highly contextual. Nobody wants to suddenly realize that the person they just became Facebook friends with yesterday poured through 5 years of their history and actually paid enough attention to bring up something that happened years ago. The actual act of quickly scanning a new friend's profile isn't really weird, but you have to admit, in a real life social situation, it's a bit awkward to bring something up from it that you weren't personally involved in that happened a long time ago. It just makes you seem like you're coming on really strong.

Also, I think in most people's minds, there is still a disconnect between social networks and reality. Sometimes it's just a bit unsettling to realize that everything you put on social media reaches a MUCH larger audience than you might have *really* intended for it to, harmless or not.

So there are a number of reasons for some people reacting negatively to bringing up something from a social network. I'm not sure that really changes your view at all, but it's an interesting discussion.","One problem is that neither Facebook nor humans have ultra fine ways of filtering their content. You might have a couple groups that you limit access to, but even that's quite a bit of effort and not very effective. 

Say you just become friends with someone. You likely weren't part of their lives in any meaningful way five years ago. You don't know that much about their personal history. They aren't the same person they were then either - they look different, hold different opinions and have a different assortment of friends. 

There's nothing at all strange or off putting for my old friends from elementary school to visit my mom and look through her old photo albums. If someone I recently met did that, that would be incredibly disturbing. What are they really trying to get at? Do they think that this old content is going to give them insight into me and my life, and if so, that's a pretty high level of effort and personal engagement. 

Facebook has also changed *a lot*. These days it's very much about transient social interactions. Personal information is off the main page and pictures usually just get thrown up rather than put in organized folders. I'd argue that interactions, images and often even personal information on Facebook aren't nearly as good of a way to get a sense of someone as they once were. 

When you comment on an old item, you are usually doing it out of context.  Commenting publicly is also a performative public act, not a personal communication. 

Still, this also doesn't mean that there aren't people that need to chill. Some people literally consider it to be 'creeping' if you mention the things they've posted publicly to them in person. It's almost like they're so detached from their social media life that they don't fully identify with the person that generated and shared that content. That's stupid. 

Some people call any interaction with their public content by someone they don't like 'creeping'. No, you should unfriend or restrict them if you don't want them seeing your content or ask them to stop if you don't like their comments.

But the above arguments don't address those cases - they look at the cases where digging up old content be a real signal that someone's both extremely, perhaps worrisomely enthralled with your life and feels the need to respond to it performatively. Remember, it's not just looking when you Comment or Like - it's a public performance.

"You act like MRA activists being pitted against feminism is entirely the fault of MRA's.

That's a bit simplistic I think. I certainly won't argue that it is just the fault of feminists either though.

The truth is, both MRAs and Feminists have extremely unhelpful extremist elements in their midst that frankly need to be denounced by the mainstream of both sides. Feminists love to complain about Misogyny in the MRM, but ignore any misandry among their own, or even claim that it doesn't exist.

I'm not just talking about feminists who want all men to die (and those do exist). There are plenty of popular mainstream feminist with views that would be called sexist if the genders were reversed.

Like Anita Sarkisian, who blames school shootings on ""toxic musculinity"", or claims video games make us sexist. She is not some extreme outlier or straw man. The fact that she raised hundreds of thousands on Kickstarter alone shows how mainstream her views are.

The fact is, whether you agree or disagree with the MRM or its methods, there is a reason it exists. In many cases these are former feminists who felt drowned out or ridiculed when they tried to talk about men's issues. Instead of denouncing them, feminists should take a good, hard look at themselves and really question why these people don't feel welcome in their community.

And there are issues were feminist are not only not acting on men's issues, but actively oppose equality for men. (#notall ofc.) Feminists have for example pushed for lighter sentencing for women, when they are already hugely advantaged in that respect.

Many feminist push for woman quotas in male-dominated fields, which many feel would mainly result in more discrimination against men then less against women.

I'm sure others could list more examples.

The fact is, it simply isn't a coincidence that the movement is called FEMinism. And despite its grand claims, most members usually behave according to the name.

Feminism (complete with Patriarchy theory etc.) just isn't the answer to create equality for all, or else either the MRM wouldn't exist, or there would be a womens movement on its opposite. So you really can't just ""rebrand"" it intro egalitariansim and ignore the underlying issues. A movement for true egalitarian values has to show these values in itself. And feminism, even mainstream feminism just doesn't in word or deed.","You seem to be coming from the premise that the anti-male parts of the feminist movement and the anti-feminist parts of the MRM are similarly extreme. I would disagree. Reading men's rights campaigners such as Ally Fogg (who I would highly recommend), I see a battle for one of the few campaigners whose motivation is to improve the lives of men, rather than as a reaction against feminism, to find a collective he can work with. He is forced to spend almost as much time fighting MRAs as anti-male feminists, simply because he recognises that the way to achieve his equality aims is not to blame everything on women. My contention is that until the MRM can move on from the reactionary core that defines so much of its work, and recognise the value of feminism and the equality of women (which includes accepting the ways in which women are still disadvantaged), the idea that feminism should accept MRAs and concede to their perspectives would be a betrayal of feminism's most fundamental principles. 

So, in conclusion, I agree with your suggestion of collaboration in principle, but the reactionary and misogynistic principles that make up so much of the MRM make this impossible in the short term.

"&gt; Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself more and more money without bearing any of the expense. I lost my job last month and I’m on unemployment. Why should I get a say in how much money I get when I am living off the work of others?

I want to focus on your moral argument here. This argument works perfectly well for membership to a country club, homeowner's association, or even a church. Why should somebody who doesn't pay the fees be allowed to participate in the club, much less dictate how the club is run? But the state is not a business. Paying taxes is not the same as paying a membership fee.

For one thing, participation in the state is involuntary. The state does a lot of other things besides provide services. The state also imprisons people, bombs other countries, conscripts people to fight in wars, determines which medical procedures I am allowed to procure, and tells me when, where, and whether I am even allowed to buy certain products. These things all affect me, even if I am under the threshold where I would pay taxes. How could the state have any legitimate authority over me if I were not allowed to participate in it?","&gt;Also this would be for the best since rich people are generally smarter and more competent than poor people, and would choose better politicians that don't just appeal to emotion.

Kids aren't allowed to vote because they haven't developed their own though process not because they don't have to pay, while an adult regarding how he perform is considered being able to think on its own.

"The 300 pound elephant in the room, and that's kind of a small elephant, but still, is that we need illegals. They work in certain jobs that traditional Americans don't. 

Also, no matter what laws we place, we will never defeat the massive amount of economic incentive for people to come over here. If Americans could make far, far, far more moving to Canada we would make the trip legal or not. 

So the fact that we have job sectors that require illegal work and they will simply come over anyway because of economic incentive, what we need is a much stronger guest worker program.  

There are people who would love to work the season an then go back to their home countries. Our current laws make this impossible. Once you're here you stay. 

If we had a solid guest worker program it would solve a fair amount of problems. 

More laws are simply going to run into a lot of economic incentive. It is very difficult to counter economic incentive just by laws. ","&gt; Let me start off by saying that I am not against legal immigration in anyway, and am only against illegal immigration. I believe that illegal immigrants should not be given amnesty for plenty of reasons.


&gt; A) They broke the law, and should be punished, not rewarded, for doing so. There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient.

This strikes me as, and I'm going to be honest here, unbearably naive and simplistic.

First of all , ""They broke the law and should be punished.""

Ok, but you haven't explained why that punishment *has* to be deportation. Not only is it going to cost the US billions of dollars tracking down and deporting 11 million people, it leaves off the table other methods of punishment. Punishments that could include:

Paying a large fine to the taxpayers

Community service

Larger amount of paycheck going to payroll taxes (social security)

Lower on the tier list for government job prospects

Just deporting them all isn't good for the country. Certainly not as good a deal as having them pay us money. This also doesn't deal with the problem that most of the jobs they do Americans don't wan to do anyway. And this:

&gt; There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient.

I mean, come on. I hate calling people out but this is just textbook ""American not realizing how good they have it.""

If a guy has a hungry family, he isn't just breaking the law because it is ""convenient."" He's not shoplifting his favorite pair of sneakers. They are taking a **huge** risk coming here, and working a tremendous amount (I believe the average work week for an illegal immigrant is well over 50 hours..close to 60) in order to **not starve.** Honestly, if I was in their position I would do the same thing. Do you really expect people to just say, ""Oh, since it is against the law for me to climb that fence, me and my family are just gonna starve."" Fuck that. Sending them back because they ""broke a law"" is just flat out immoral. They had to be pretty desperate to take all those risks, uproot themselves from their homes, and move their whole family to a foreign country where they don't even speak the language.

&gt; B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions. They are willing to work for less, and are much less likely to complain when they are abused. Many businesses take advantage of such people to save costs, and treat their illegal immigrant workers unfairly.

Ironically, these problems would all be solved if they were given amnesty.

As for your crime stats, I'm pretty sure those are misleading / cherrypicked, but I'm not sure so I cannot dispute it. However, it is silly to deport *all* illegals. Just deport the ones caught committing crimes. Much easier, cheaper, and more effective than checking everyones papers whos name is Jose.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more pragmatic and realistic approach to the issue of illegal immigration. It acknowledges the economic incentives that drive people to come to the US and suggests a solution that takes into account the need for labor in certain sectors. It also proposes a guest worker program as a way to address the issue without resorting to mass deportations. Response 2, on the other hand, focuses more on punishment and legalities without offering a comprehensive solution to the problem.",0
"(Please note that I am arguing against the view expressed in the title)

&gt; My view is that while we can be taught, it is up to us to learn through our own experiences and choose whether or not to accept the said teachings, as opposed to blind faith

This is, in essence, the difference between science and religion.

Theories and laws in science are based on reproducible experiments - this means that anyone with the right equipment should be able to reach the same results as anyone else when doing the experiment. This, in itself, makes science un-dogmatic (is that even a word?).  
Naturally, not everyone can complete the experiments themselves, so we trust that an experiment is good if a number of independent scientists reproduce it - this is known as peer reviewing. This introduces a *bit* of what you're talking about, as we have to trust a ""higher authority"" (in this case a number of scientists) that what they're saying is true. However, this is a trade off that is impossible to solve, and as such must be accepted for all knowledge.

However, what I think you're talking about is how this knowledge is spread to the general public. In ""popular science"" shows, you'll often find that new hypothesis' or theories are presented as truths - which is wrong. These are not truths, and within the scientific community they are not considered as such. In fact, truth as an absolute does not exist as a scientific term. In other words, science is not dogmatic. However, some media can present it in a dogmatic way.","Ooh I love discussing this! It saddens me that science and religion are seen as opposite ends of a spectrum. As you said, science by and large arose from religious people.


Addressing the topic, both scientists and theists are often dogmatic. Where you are wrong is the part where you said science itself and religion itself is dogmatic. The true nature of both are not dogmatic. I am using only Christianity as religion in this argument because that is what I am most familiar with and I'm sure you can find a religion that is dogmatic but Christianity I have found to also be most reasonable. 


The Bible says that ""faith is the evidence of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."" This is basically the definition of science though the word faith isn't used ever in scientific circles because over the years, the definition of faith has become ""belief without evidence"" (dogmatic) as opposed to the biblical definition above, which is clearly not dogmatic, it requires evidence and reason. Paul in fact once said ""we are not mad, but merely speak the words of truth and reason."" 


I'd also like to point out that having an absolute standard is not necessarily dogmatic. Saying ""This is the absolute standard, follow it because fuck you."" is certainly dogmatic. However, it is not dogmatic to say: ""This absolute standard that I am about to give you is directly from the mouth of God who created you and who created morality itself. I will now show you proof that I am from God because *insert evidence*. To show the power of God I will now perform a miracle in front of all of you so you can tell others and document it painstakingly throughout the years. Now that you believe me, I will now lay down the standard and explain why this makes sense. This is obviously the best option but it is up to you to make the right choice, I won't make you."" The Bible says and does basically this. 


Whether you believe the evidence in the Bible or evidence for God in general is irrelevant to this conversation. If in your opinion the evidence does not hold up, ok that's fine. But don't say that it is dogmatic because it isn't, it presented evidence and a choice. 


Now, science should do the same thing. Gather the evidence, make a hypothesis, gather even more evidence, make it a theory, have hundreds of to people besides you gather a crap ton of overwhelming evidence that points to one conclusion and then MAYBE make it a scientific law. And after that, never stop gathering evidence in case you are wrong. 


What happens sometimes is this process is not always followed and things become a theory without enough evidence because of bias or the innate lack of evidence so the option that makes the most sense is upgraded to a theory. What also happens is some individual scientists become very dogmatic and arrogant and treat flimsy hypothesis like indisputable facts and criticize anyone who does not agree. 


Christians can and do do the same thing, as well as setting their own traditions on the same level as the Bible. But does this mean science itself and religion itself are inherently dogmatic. No. No no no. ",2,2,True,Response 2 provides a clear and concise explanation of the difference between science and religion in terms of reproducibility and peer review. It also addresses the issue of how knowledge is spread to the general public and acknowledges the limitations of popular science shows.

"Marriage is an emotional commitment more than anything. Reason can pull you both ways, either into it for financial and legal reasons (tax cuts, if there was ever an accident you'd be legally recognized as next of kin, etc.) or out of it for practicality reasons. Unless you're religious and/or you desire offspring, marriage is something that can be easily considered trivial.


That said, I can see how your experience with divorce has colored your views, and rightly so. But you need to not let fear of a single potential outcome determine your approach to something. Especially if that something is a thing that someone you consider precious would like as part of her future.


Consider for a moment what marriage in the modern day is... In truth, it's just legally recognized love. That is to say that if you love this girl, and you're already committed to her wholly, then you're emotionally already married but without the tax cuts, the legal recognition, and the failsafe should things go sour (divorce court). 


And as an aside, as many have said, the expense of a wedding is not something that needs to be a concern unless it's of personal concern to you both. Personally, my husband and I bought wooden rings off Etsy (his was $60, mine was $200 because it's ebony from Isreal), and we eloped. The expense? The price of the marriage license and the fuel to get it. And let me tell you, I have zero regrets about that, it was exactly how we wanted it when we wanted it. 


And a little bonus, people like giving wedding gifts. We set up a GoFundMe page because we didn't want gifts, but cash, and ended up coming out with over a grand in gift money. So it's not all bad =)","I don't know about your jurisdiction, but if the downside for you is the legal risk of divorce/financial  support, etc.  You may already be incurring that risk by being in a cohabiting relationship.

"There are a couple problems with that proposal:

* **Cost** - stationing an armed guard at every school would be extremely expensive

* **Environment** - When you do something like this, it's a message to the students that not only is it possible for something to happen to them, it is likely enough to warrant hiring guards. Kids have enough stresses as it is.

"What about a country like Syria or Iraq that used weapons of mass destruction **against its own citizens**?  The US used primitive nuclear weapons to end a war with fewer casualties on both sides after dropping millions of leaflets alerting the area of their intentions.  The US has been involved in several wars since then without using nukes.  

The US has a large military and stable government, and has the legitimacy as a state to secure its nuclear weapons.  I think a semi-failed state like Sudan, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, etc would be much more dangerous to possess nuclear weapons because they much more easily could fall into the hands of terrorists.  

Finally, the US faces no immediate threat, and is unlikely to have to threaten to use Nuclear weapons in the face of an immediate and existential invasion.  I think it is more dangerous for a country like Israel to possess nuclear weapons because they much more easily could be put in a point where they think they need to use them to defend against a conventional attack or face their destruction","&gt;The USA dropped 2 atomic bombs, not as retribution to an atomic attack.

No other country has as much to lose as the US when it comes to stuff like that.  Our entire country depends on trade and relatively good relations with the rest of the goods-producing world.  Using nuclear weapons outside of that context would certainly be the end of the US.

"I think that you underestimate the influence that romance languages had on English as it was developing, and I would argue that it is an equally important component . For English to go back to its ""roots"" where only Anglo-Saxon counts, you would need to COMPLETELY restructure the language to something incomprehensible to modern English speakers. You would essentially be creating an entirely new language. 

The concept of language regulators is a relatively new concept that developed during colonial times. In fact, the oldest thing that resembles a current language regulator is the Oxford ENGLISH Dictionary. This was created long after Old Norman had entered the picture. It should also be noted that a lot of the major differences in American and British spelling and pronunciation came about when organizations tried to codify the language, as you are suggesting we do.

As a bookkeeper, I think it is wrong to imply that English does not create words using simple concepts. I also think it is wrong to suggest that creating words out of simple concepts would streamline English or make it easier to understand. A bookkeeper could also be a librarian or a bookstore owner using your version of English. On /r/Anglish they give kangaroo as an example, explaining that ""leapdeer"" could be an alternative, but what would call gazelle, or impala, or antelopes? They are all types of deer that have a penchant for leaping. Anglish may have worked 1300 years ago when the world was a much simpler place, but English has evolved with the times to describe the ever-expanding universe.

From what I can tell, most contemporary Germanic languages use variations of the greek words to describe sciences. So English is not alone in that change. I also find the concept of calling Geology ""Earthlore"" upsetting. As lore in contemporary English has the connotation of being fictitious, and the only people who view Geology as fictitious are creationists! 

On a personal level, the reasons you give for wanting a language regulator are the reasons I love English. English is not pretentious, it is not caught up in maintaining itself or its purity. I like that we argue over the Oxford comma and the pronunciation of gif (HARD G). That we add selfie to the dictionary and that we don't call tacos ""stuffed flat bread"". If a language already has a word for something we just take it as is (minus some bastardization for pronunciation purposes) and add it to the dictionary. If it doesn't have a word for it and move on. I like that we do not have an official body that is fretting over whether outside influences are destroying our language and culture. At its core English is a language of inclusion, adaptation, and growth. What you see as a detriment to the language, I see as a benefit. Since English is such a vast and chaotic language non-native speakers can get away with a lot more and we'll still understand them.","**""The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and riffle their pockets for new vocabulary."" ** -- [James Nicoll ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nicoll)

French, as you pointed out, has a language regulator with the power to decide what is and is not proper French. There are roughly 77 million native French speakers in the world. By comparison, English, which has no such authoritative regulator, has about 400 million speakers. It is the language of [business](https://hbr.org/2012/05/global-business-speaks-english), the [language](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29543708) of [science](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/01/english_is_the_language_of_science_u_s_dominance_means_other_scientists.html), even the language of international [air travel](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/761307/English-to-become-compulsory-for-pilots.html). It is overall seen as the [dominant](http://www.cepr.org/PRESS/DP2055PR.htm) international language today: where a Belgian and an Argentinian may not speak each other's native language, there is a reasonable chance they both speak English, and so has a great deal of utility. At best, French is maintained as the language of [diplomacy](http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy) but even that is starting to be supplanted by [English](http://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/language-of-diplomacy/), which makes sense considering that more people know English by many, many degrees. Ironically enough, French is no longer the lingua franca in much of the world. 

Why is this? Partially, it can be explained by the political dominance of, first, the British Empire and, immediately after, the American Empire. But another reason is that, contrary to your assertion, its willingness to absorb the words of other languages makes it easier to pick up and use by non-native speakers. French, and other linguistically purist cultures, take a protectionist approach to their language, carefully pruning it to make sure it grows only in the way they want it to grow. By contrast, English takes a more free market approach, where words can easily cross borders and be changed to suit the needs of whomever uses them--if French is a carefully pruned topiary, English is an all-devouring kudzu vine. While a topiary certainly looks better, and may be less bothersome, none can argue that it grows faster, and requires less maintenance, than kudzu. This, in fact, is criticized as [linguistic imperialism. ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_imperialism) Whether or not one agrees that the spread of English is a good thing, none can deny that this is indeed happening on a mass scale. 

This makes intuitive sense: a language that can be easily adapted and modified and changed will spread more quickly than a language that cannot, because ultimately languages are utilitarian creatures. People learn them to use them, and if a language is more difficult to use, then it will be more difficult (and less appealing) to learn. English readily accepts loan words. French, official ""proper"" French (not speaking of colloquial French here), does not. English is simply a more hospitable environment for foreign words, and this has in turn made English more attractive. If we think of it in terms of nations, all other things being equal, which country will have more immigrants: one with an open door policy and a speedy path to citizenship, or one with a highly restrictive immigration policy with an exhaustive and lengthy path to citizenship? 

So, contrary to your view, English's lack of regulation has actually made it *easier* to learn, not harder. The trouble people have when learning English usually has to do mainly with the grammar structure than the vocabulary. This is a good problem to have, because a vocabulary mistake can be easily corrected, while a grammatical mistake (we're talking big ones, like wrong word order, versus ending sentences with prepositions) cripples understanding. Further, while this is highly subjective (but then again, so is your point), I believe that English's willingness to change and adopt foreign words as its own (and adopt and change foreign words too) makes it very beautiful. There are concepts that simply cannot be expressed with English words on hand, and so it's quite useful to be able to simply take another word to fill in the gap, and so thereby increase the language's range of expression. If we were only restricted to Anglo-Saxon derived words, the things we could communicate would, I believe, contract significantly. 

Upon further thought, I also find it odd you would single out English for having inconsistencies in grammar, spelling, pronunciation and more--every language has weird things about it that can confound even native speakers. This even includes French. Much of this inconsistency comes from colloquial usage and geographic diversity. Sure, it's weird that some people insist on calling ""soda"" ""pop"" instead, but I don't think the country needs to settle on one definitive word to use for ""sugary, fizzy beverage."" 

Ultimately, to trap the English language in amber like some Jurassic-era mosquito is to remove the vitality, dynamism, adaptability and diversity that makes it such a strong language in the first place. This does mean, of course, that the English of today won't be the English of 100 years from now, just as it's not the English of 100 years ago, but that's a feature, not a bug. A language that cannot, will not, adapt will find itself to be like a highly specialized organism that does extremely well for its niche but is unable to adjust to changing circumstance--and those organisms tend to go extinct much faster.

"In the example you cited, the 'grey' is in the man's noble intentions (contrast it with stealing bread only to throw it away, just to make the shopkeeper suffer).

So, when someone has an intersex condition they have either ambiguous genitalia, gonads or chromosomes. Currently the brain isn't included in the definition of intersex. That said, there is pretty [strong evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure) that being trans is a neurological condition. In my opinion it should be considered a congenital neurological intersex condition.

Now, if you read the first few paragraphs you'll find out two things: first, the BSTc is hormone aplastic (it doesn't change shape based on the level of sex hormones), and second, that it doens't differentiate until adulthood, but we have trans people being certain about their gender well before then, so we have to look elsewhere for a cause (at least for early onset gender things).

If the BSTc doesn't change shape, then it's obviously not relevant to genderfluidity, though being part way between the two sizes might account for gender being looser than normal. But what about the parts of the brain that are sensitive to sex hormones and do change based on the pretense or absence of E or T? [This article](http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S107.full) talks about the parts of the brain that *do* change based on hormone therapy. If someone's brain is not especially solidified because of the aplasitc parts being somewhere in the middle, then slight hormone fluctuations could well switch identity from one side to another. I'm not saying that that *is* how it works, since it's not a thing that has been studied all that much, but it's certainly well within the realm of possibility based on what we do know about gender.

Androgyny is based on appearance, and not identity. Agender is a thing, but it is not the same as gender fluid. Trans people don't or can't always get genital surgery, this doesn't make them any less of a man or woman than any other man or woman with a condition that caused them to lose their genitals. 

The 'man changing in front of little girls' thing is a pretty big stereotype that doesn't really happen. Stalls are a thing, and most gender non-conforming people are well aware of the shape of their bodies, and bladder issues are a pretty big issue for a lot of trans people who have to hold their pee in all day because they can't use public washrooms without the risk of physical assault.

Generally if someone is genderfluid, they'll know you have no way of knowing they are identifying as that day, so they probably won't flip out at you. But you can always ask.","I am by no means an expert, I've just been really interested in gender/sexuality issues for a while and I'll explain it how it makes sense to me. So please if someone is reading this and I am wrong, correct me please!! 

I look at this in 3 categories: sex, gender, and sexuality. I see sex as being your physical situation, sexuality being who you are attracted to, and gender being how you feel inside. Sex, to me, can be male, female, intersex, or any combination thereof. This is fairly straightforward and there aren't many arguments about this, I think.

Sexuality is the next easiest one, and it seems like you understand this one pretty similarly to how I do. A little nuance here is the separation of sexual attraction and romantic attraction, so for example you can want to be romantic with people but totally uninterested in sex (heteroromantic, asexual). These two things are important in defining gender.

I'm gonna talk about transgender people for a minute as a preface to gender. Generally, transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, which is recognized in the [DSM-V](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) (it used to be called gender identity disorder until this edition of the DSM), and take steps to alleviate it by either transitioning (hormones, surgery) or presenting (binders, makeup, clothes) as another gender. Transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, and more often than not, they have serious body dysphoria as well,  where they feel disgusted by their bodies or just feeling ""wrong"" in their skin. It's a horrible place to be mentally and can lead to serious depression and self harm. That's why hormone replacement therapy is important, because it tries to eliminate body dysphoria or at least tone it down a few notches. I bring this up because gender fluidity is basically the same thing, except gender fluid people either do not have body dysphoria or they do not experience it to the same degree. They have the same feelings of ""wrongness"" about aligning their gender with their sex, and personally I think this has a lot to do with how pervasive gender roles are in society.  

There are *lots* of classes of gender fluidity, and while some of them are fluid on a day-to-day basis like you described, the more common varieties tend to sit somewhere in the middle. The [Genderbread Person](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2015/03/the-genderbread-person-v3/) (with a more in-depth explanation [here](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/)) is a really awesome illustration that you can play around with. It's a combination of identity (how you feel) and expression (how you present), using socially defined gender norms of femininity and masculinity.

An important thing to keep in mind is, when we are looking at issues like restrooms or changing rooms, is that individuals who are genderfluid are not ""men going in a women's bathroom"" or ""women in a man's changing room,"" because I feel like that has more of a predatory connotation. It's really up to the individual which one they want to use. In my opinion, changing rooms are not a big deal, but restrooms go by what you present as (ex. if you are a trans-man, you use a stall in the men's restroom). (As mentioned in another comment, gender neutral restrooms are the best way to solve this I think, and more and more public places are starting to implement them which is really awesome!!)

The way I look at it is like, since hormone therapy requires recommendations from doctors and therapists, legally identifying as genderfluid should be managed the same way.",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a clear breakdown of the categories of sex, gender, and sexuality, and explains the concept of gender fluidity in a relatable and empathetic way. It also addresses the issue of restrooms and changing rooms in a respectful manner. The use of the Genderbread Person illustration helps to visually explain the complexity of gender identity. Overall, Response 2 presents a more organized and comprehensive argument that is likely to be more persuasive.",0
"I think what you have identified is simply that there are socially sanctioned relationship preferences, and socially unsanctioned preferences, depending on context.

For instance, a man can have an internal, silent preference for lean women, but depending on the context, if he vocalizes it, he is likely to receive criticism.

Women who have a preference for tall men tend to face less open criticism for that preference, even when voiced openly.

Both genders tend to not be criticized for openly wanting an intelligent and/or successful partner, in the same way that both genders are essentially never criticized for not wanting a dumb loser.

These socially accepted preferences change over time, and what you are identifying is a universally condemned attribute transitioning out of that realm. For most of history, sexual promiscuity in women has been universally condemnable, and so it's not unexpected to have a large portion of people who still ascribe to that social custom. As customs go, there is no ""correct"" viewpoint. 

As western society has grown more progressive, this particularly female heavy bias against promiscuity has begun to equalize, and we are simply in the tumultuous transition period. There are plenty of people who say it makes zero difference in their choice, and plenty of people who only consider someone who is a virgin. Both are merely choices.

As far as your view goes, I don't necessarily disagree with your position, but I disagree with your oversimplification. 

Slut is a subjective term. Ask 10 people what it means and the only common thread will be sexual promiscuity. There will be a wide range of pejorative attitudes about the term, but the problem lies in the fact that it is exclusively an insult that gets wrongly applied to people with multiple sexual partners.

Consider a young woman, who is 32, and has had only serious boyfriends her whole life. She started dating at 16, lost her virginity to her first boyfriend, and has had a sexual relationship with each of her boyfriends, with a consistent duration of approximately 18-24 months per bf. This gives her a sexual partner range of 8-11 (rounding up). Now, to many people, the number 11 could seem like a high ""slutty"" number, when in reality she has merely had a long string of moderately long, monogamous relationships, that even allow for something as conservative as a 6-month waiting period before sex.

Consider another person, who had one serious relationship at 16, lost their virginity, broke up when she went to college, and then drunkenly slept with 5 guys in her first year. The next year she met her college sweetheart, and they stayed together for 12 years before breaking up. She is now roughly as old as the first woman, yet has only 7 partners. However, the means at which she got to her 7 as opposed the the other woman's 11 is monumentally different.

So while it doesn't necessarily mean nothing, it is a worthless metric without context. As both those women have had very different sexual pasts, and if you were taking either one of them on a date at 32, their respective pasts would mean very different things to you. 

Now, to bring it back to the word slut, you can see how using that word to describe either of them would mean **very** different things. One of them had a very slow accumulation of partners through 1.5-2 year relationships, and the other had the vast majority of all her partners during one short burst in college, with the previous decade+ being solely monogamous.","I've read through many of the comments here, and I appreciate that you have awarded several deltas. I hope the perspective I can offer on this is different enough from what has already been said to be of value to you. 

Here's my take. You state in your OP that preferences such as height and weight are generally accepted in our society. Absolutely true. You say in a comment that smoking is a deal breaker for you, that you would never date a woman who smokes. Fair enough. You also say this:

&gt;A context that came to mind when writing it is the /r/relationship[1] posts where the partner learns after-the-fact that his girlfriend/wife (or her husband/boyfriend) had more partners than originally assumed.

To me, the difference is that physical appearance and smoking affect you in the present. I could see deciding not to date someone because they have a reputation for promiscuity or because you correlate a higher number of sexual partners with an increased proclivity to cheat or an inability to maintain a healthy relationship. I'm not saying these correlations are correct, but I could understand your hesitation. However, in the scenarios you described, your wife or girlfriend is presumably a woman with whom you have built a solid trust, who has proven herself to be faithful and capable of being a partner. I can understand being upset if she lied to you about the number in the past, but even in this case, empathy suggests that she was probably embarrassed or fearful of judgment/rejection. In your scenario, breaking up with the girl for the number of sexual partners she has had is more accurately comparable with breaking up with her because she used to be fat or because she is an ex-smoker. A person can't change that they used to be fat or that they used to smoke or unsleep with past sexual partners, but they can lose weight and quit smoking and build a healthy monogamous relationship.

I also have qualms with this argument:

&gt;Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers.

What if instead of your example of physically fit men who are chubby-chasers, we are talking about obese women who only want to date men with six-pack abs? Or obese men who only want to date models? Yes, they are still entitled to have that preference, but most of us won't be surprised or particularly sympathetic when they don't find a partner. It is hypocritical because they want a partner who takes care of their body, but are not willing to put in the effort themselves. In the same respect, it is hypocritical for you to want a partner who has maintained her chastity, while not be willing to put forth the same effort. Women have a desire for sex too, and I think it is reasonable in this scenario to compare resisting the temptation to have sex with resisting the temptation to eat junk food or watch TV/play video games instead of going to the gym.

Lastly, I have one more angle to approach this from. With emerging adulthood and people getting married later, 5+ sexual partners is not necessarily promiscuous. Expecting a woman to be a virgin or have a very low number of previous sexual partners was much more reasonable when people were getting married in their late teens or early twenties. Now, with the average age of marriage closer to 30, many people will have had other significant relationships before they meet the person they marry. We have a longer period of time to work on and learn about ourselves before we settle down, and for many people this includes dating and sexual exploration. Personally, I'm averaging less than one new sexual partner per year since I started having sex, but my number is higher than 5. Yeah, if I got to go back as the person I am today, I would make some different decisions. But I've learned from them and I have no regrets. And I feel you dude, I don't like to think about the women my partner has been with either. But they brought him to me. In the end, unless they contracted an incurable STD or you believe sex is morally wrong, the people our partners slept with before they met us don't really matter. What matters is the person we are with now.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a more detailed and empathetic perspective on the issue at hand. It addresses the OP's concerns about past sexual partners in a nuanced way, highlighting the importance of trust and empathy in a relationship. Response 1 also challenges the OP's argument by comparing it to other preferences such as physical appearance and smoking, which helps to broaden the OP's perspective on the issue.",0
"Napoleon had very little chance of conquering Europe even if he had won at Waterloo. There was another massive Russian/Austrian army on the way to join the British and the Prussians. Almost all of Europe was fairly united in their opposition to Napoleon and you cannot wage war against an entire continent, no matter how good of a general you are. Add the fact that many of the reasons that were behind Napoleon's earlier successes were no longer present - the allies had reformed their armies, were coordinating their operations better, and learned from their previous mistakes. France, on the other hand, was drained of its manpower and was economically exhausted. In short, Napoleon's chances of rebuilding his empire were very slim. At best, he would be embroiled in continuous game of wack-a-mole where one part or another rebelled. It would be an unending war with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of casualties. 

That aside, the article is extremely generous to Napoleon, more than he deserves. Napoleon crowned himself Emperor - hardly a republican thing to do. He invaded countries or threatened them  with invasion to make them comply with his demands. He installed his family members and close associates as kings and dukes of conquered territories. He forced conquered peoples to pay him taxes to fund his next campaigns and enforced the continental blockade against their will. 

You can't really frame the Napoleonic wars as ones of republicanism  vs monarchism. Britain was a constitutional monarchy and was staunchly against Napoleon. In Spain, Napoleon faced a national uprising against his rule (or rather Napoleon's brother whom he tried to install as king).  

Saying that Napoleon wanted peace in 1805 or 1809 is a bit disingenuous. Saddam Hussein also wanted peace after conquering Kuwait. Does that make the United States and the UN forced that launched Operation Desert Storm in 1991 the aggressors? Hitler didn't want war with Great Britain and France after he invaded Poland in 1939. They declared war on Germany - are they the aggressors? Why should we take 1805 or 1809 as the baseline? You have to consider the context.","Not disagreeing but wanting to add a few things. 

1) Napoleon's heirs shared none of his genius if anything they weren't that bright (the final Napoleon ended up being killed by the Zulu)

2) Russia was not necessarily a mistake in of itself. Napoleon's mistake at Russia (besides his lack of tactics in a big battle that led to many french men dying needlessly) was not turning around from Moscow as soon as he burned it. He ended up staying for another month in Moscow

3) even if he won Waterloo he would have still faced opposition from the British who would have pounced after he died and stirred dissent",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a detailed explanation of why Napoleon's chances of conquering Europe were slim even if he had won at Waterloo. It highlights the geopolitical situation, the state of France, and the changing dynamics of the Napoleonic wars.

"I find it amusing that people always try to find some sort of loophole, rather than answering the actual question (""I'll blow up the trolley with a rocket launcher""). It doesn't really get you anywhere.

Anyways:

It's unethical to push the person off the bridge because people have rights. As a society, we have deemed it invalid to evaluate the lives of people as some sort of commodity, so you can't say it's moral to just trade on life for five.

The person standing on the bridge has the right to not be murdered, for any reason. Including saving the lives of others. It's easier to get a feel for this when you escalate the scenario, like 'transplant' scenario that somebody else brought up. The point is that 5 lives for 1 is a nice idea, but it shouldn't supersede the rights of the individual.","if one has not committed a murder before then knowingly pushing someone to their death is to big of a burden on most people regardless of whats at stake.

you see efficiency wise you might safe more people, but in doing so you harm yourself.  Self harm should always be avoided

also, the person you kill does not care what reason you kill him for,  he dies, it doesn't matter if its because you wanted to on a whim or because all life on the planet is at risk.  he would not want to be murdered (unless the scenario states that he does)

"Plenty of people have employment that requires spending 3-12 months on site for a project and then leaving.  Sometimes this can be on the other side of the country, sometimes it can be another country.

Furthermore, some people, especially wealthier people, prefer only to drive newer cars and don't want to have to worry about the maintenance at all.

"&gt; I was a regular upper-middle class guy who went to public school. I loved it. My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe.

Not all public schools are equal. Others have already made this point, but you'd learn a lot if you listened to [these](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) [two](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/563/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-two) episodes of This American Life. Public schools are also subject to the prejudices of the society that surrounds them. In those episodes you'll ~~see~~ hear parents of white children protest, loudly and vocally, against the school's decision to accept black students from another neighbourhood, despite the fact that the black kids had to travel over an hour to get to the majority-white school. It's definitely an eye-opener.

So another concern: What about the money? Currently, about [4%](http://equipeducation.org/Downloads/HomeschoolPopulationReport2010.pdf) of K-12 students in the US are homeschooled. Where would the public schools find the money to accommodate all these people?

Not all homeschooling is bad either. If you'd take a look at [these](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ794828) [two](http://equipeducation.org/Downloads/HomeschoolPopulationReport2010.pdf) studies you'll see that homeschooled students perform at least just as well as students attending public schools. The second study is the most interesting since it shows that with good, structured homeschooling the children consistently outperformed public school students across several measures. Just as all public schools aren't equal, all homeschooling isn't equal. But it *can* do a very good job when used well.","As someone who loved being homeschooled, and was much better off for it, I can say that you should at least have an understanding of something before you try to make it illegal.

First, education takes up an extraordinarily large portion of children's lives and we should be careful when making significant changes. Because of this, you should realize that a all-inclusive legal mandate is probably not the best approach. Disregarding any issues of parental rights, it's generally more efficient and productive to allow for homeschooling. Parents are generally more in-tune to their children's needs and care more about the quality of education. Even though many academically challenged students are switched to homeschooling, homeschoolers consistently perform better on standardized testing.

&gt; Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged

You should research homeschooling more, instead of relying on stereotypes, if you actually think this is the case.

Second, it's evident from your post that you do not understand the US public school system (I'm assuming US from the context of your post). Most people would laugh at the naive belief that:

&gt; In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.

The most obvious issue with this is that public schools are already staggeringly unequal. Here's a great video about education and some of its issues:
http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms

&gt; The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage.

Again, it seems like you are basing your opinion off of ignorant stereotypes. Approach the issue from a perspective of assumed ignorance--try to learn about something before you form an opinion. 

&gt; I have never seen any benifit to private school. 

They usually teach spelling and communication which are important life skills.

&gt; My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe

While it's nice that your anecdotal experience went well for you, have the capacity to realize that it doesn't necessarily apply in all, or even the majority, of cases.

Finally, realize that ""I don't like X"" shouldn't always translate to ""X should be illegal""; X, in this case, is homeschooling. A recurring anthem for this forum full of  ""There should be a LAW"" posts:

"The problem with kicking somebody out is the potential backlash from enforcement. If the parents willfully take the kid out, there's no problem.

"""It's the cost of doing business"". 

If a business owner doesn't like their clientele, they are more than welcome to simply stop doing business. (Main difference from slavery is that business owners can walk away.) Alternately you can stop doing business with the general public and become a private store/club instead and only serve your members. 

Non-Discrimination laws are no different than being required to accept currency, building handicap accessible buildings/accommodations, or even not being allowed to be open during certain hours. In the areas that have them it's simply part of the environment of doing business in that area. 

What the argument boils down to at an individual level is ""I doan wanna."". (It may help to imagine that said in the voice of a pouty 3 year old to get the full effect. 

On a more macroscopic scale it boils down to whose ""rights, responsibilities, and or privileges are more important"". In the cases alluded to the responsibility of the public shop owner is to serve the public. If they posted that they didn't do certain designs (like a confederate flag or a swastika or a burning cross, or effigies of presidents for example) and then refused to do that design, they would still be serving the public and not compromising whatever artistic/workmanship integrity they have. That's fine. 

But to arbitrarily refuse service to certain members of the public is not. 

Even without legal rationale... if you open your business, skills and talents for hire in a community... then you need to accept the business of all of the community. Not just the parts that you like. Because if we allow businesses to do that as a community, it tears apart the community. 

This isn't to say that you can't have standards such as a dress code which theoretically anybody can meet, or income requirement etc. But those aren't based on who somebody is. Just what they happen to have at the moment.

For example, in a small town, there is likely to be only one hardware-store. So the question becomes, if the population can only support one hardware-store, is it important that that store be willing to serve all of the members of the community? A business which practices active discrimination in who they are willing to serve actively hurts the public good. It drives people of the group being discriminated against out of the community.

If you *know* your product is hurting people, and you can help prevent that harm by writing ""DANGER: HOT"" in big letters on the cup, it seems entirely fair to say you have to do it.","At the time of the suit McDonalds was serving coffee between 180-190F which is hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns within seconds.  Prior to Ms. Liebeck there had been 700 claims made against McDonalds for serving coffee to hot.  McDonalds admits that coffee served at that temperature is too hot for consumption as it burns the mouth and throat.  [See WSJ article](http://www.business.txstate.edu/users/ds26/Business%20Law%202361/Misc/McDonalds%20coffee.pdf)

&gt;A vascular surgeon determined that Liebeck suffered full thickness burns (or third-degree burns) over 6 percent of her body, including her inner thighs, perineum, buttocks, and genital and groin areas. She was hospitalized for eight days, during which time she underwent skin grafting. Liebeck, who also underwent debridement treatments, sought to settle her claim for $20,000, but McDonalds refused. [See](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm)



So i summation they **have** lowered the temps of the coffee to under 160 according to test conducted after the verdict, she had awful burns over her body, they knew it was an issue yet did nothing.  I wish I could find you the pictures, they aren't pretty.  ",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides specific details about the severity of the burns suffered by the plaintiff, as well as the number of previous claims against McDonalds for serving coffee that was too hot.

"OK. I'm going to look specifically at your points in turn.

1) **Physical**. Absolutely, men at their peak are stronger and faster than women. But a woman at her peak can be stronger or faster than the vast majority of men; look at [Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir](http://espn.go.com/espnw/athletes-life/article/13337513/katrin-tanja-davidsdottir-plays-mental-game-win-crossfit-games), I'm fairly certain she could take most men on and win. To further expand on your point; so what? So women are on average less strong. I'm not convinced that in the modern developed world this is a huge issue.

2) **Industry**. I really think your experiences have biased you here. [Oil refining is 18% female](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm) (actually higher than I expected). This means that there will be default be a higher chance that the 'shining stars' will be male. Some of the issues you've seen are down to culture; we have only recently started to accept women in formerly 'male' lines of work such as engineering, so a lot of women who could perhaps have made excellent engineers would never have thought of it as a career option. As for the women who aren't good at their work- I wonder, do you notice the men who aren't good at their work too?

3) **At home**. This one's awkward. There are a few different possibilities here and, I'll be honest, none of my suggestions make you look good- I hope you don't get too offended. 

* First, I noticed that the issues you mentioned were all practical. You're an engineer- that's your bag. So you notice when your girlfriend isn't good at physical things. But I wonder if you've noticed your own failings? Perhaps she's always silently annoyed that you put your foot in it at social gatherings. Maybe you're not very good at art or design. Are these problems, are you possibly less good at them than she is? **Possibly, yes**.  But this is not something for which you should be blamed. They aren't part of your skill-set, but you can learn.

* Perhaps you're impatient. When you were looking at the gear system you used your previous knowledge and applied it to the situation at hand. There's no parallel for your girlfriend; it's the same as asking someone who's only ever driven an automatic car to move to a manual. It's possible, but they will kangaroo down the road for a while before they get the hang of it. 

I remember that it was only a few years ago that my mum was terrible with computers. She's an intelligent woman, a teacher, but they weren't her thing. Why? Because she was trying to learn from me, my sister or my dad- all of whom would just say ""oh give it here"" when she was struggling. Our impatience meant she didn't learn. She did a 1-week course and came out knowing everything she needed to know because the teacher there has the patience to let her learn.

* Maybe you date stupid or physically inept women. This is possible; I can imagine that if you show this 'women are stupid' belief in the real world, intelligent women may be less likely to want to spend time with you.

--

So what does this mean? my TL;DR is that I think you're focussing on things at which you are good, measuring some women against these, then using this to judge women as a whole. 

We could talk about how [more women than men graduate college.](http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2012/feb/21/edu-women-overtake-men-in-earning-degrees-at-all/71196/) I could show you that in the [developing world women make up a growing percentage of new entrepreneurs.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/female-entrepreneurship_n_1149393.html)

But I think the most likely argument I can make is about environment. The men you hang out with are engineers. They are likely to be above average intelligence. Depending on where you meet women, they are more likely to be average. A very good friend of mine is an engineer, working for one of the top companies in the world designing airports. I like to think she'd be able to show you a thing or two!","I think most of this comes down to exposure.  Because you used your girlfriend(s) as an example, I will use mine current girlfriend to answer all of these points.

1) Physically, men are in general more superior to women.  I am about 6'2"" and 195 pounds and my girlfriend is 5'5"" and most likely 105 pounds (heaven forbid she sees this and actually weighs less).  I am significantly stronger than her but she is a much faster runner than me.

2)In the work place, my girlfriend whoops my ass in this category.  We are actually both engineering students and her GPA is better than mine (and mine is pretty good).  She also is a better and harder worker than me.

3)At home, I would say I am most likely better than my girlfriend.  I am incredible at caring for children and while I am not sure if she how good she is at something like this, I can assure I am better.  She is generally a better cook than me but I am better than her at things like cooking and cleaning.

All in all, we are pretty split in terms of things we each are better at and these traits span across various categories.  I have an extreme amount of respect for her which is maybe why I am willing to admit some of the things she is better at.

Sidenote: My ex girlfriend before her was not as good of an employee, not as intelligent, not as athletic, and not as good at any home tasks as me.  I was better than her in pretty much every sense of the word.

But like I initially said, I think it all comes down to exposure.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and nuanced analysis of the OP's points, addressing each one individually and offering alternative perspectives.

"In my experience there are two ways people solve jigsaw puzzles. One way is your way: they match shapes and colors on the pieces themselves and build the puzzle that way. The other way is my way: we use the patterns on the pieces to figure out where they go in the larger picture (using the box).

I get a lot of enjoyment doing it my way. In any decent puzzle placing figuring out where individual pieces fit in the larger picture is challenging. You get a piece that has some brown but a little blue and a grainy texture and you have to figure out where in the picture you can find those three things. And the fact that good puzzle-makers design their cuts to break up recognizable features indicates to me that they don't consider this technique cheating. It's part of the fun!

Also, I always do puzzles in groups and these two strategies are complementary. My sister is very good at doing things your way and I am good at my way. She ends up doing a lot of work very quickly while I get to puzzle over the trickier pieces.

Doing it my way you also get to know the picture well! This pleases me because I love looking at pictures.

Of course, both ways have their weaknesses, and can be more or less effective depending on the puzzle. In fact, your way may actually be more effective in general, but it's definitely not the only way to enjoy a puzzle.
","I used to totally do puzzles your way, however I have since begun to switch back and forth between strategies for different puzzles. Switching back and forth has helped me become more efficient at doing puzzles overall. Try doing a puzzle without doing the edges first: that is true hard mode.

Also, pictures should be on the box either way because I don't want to work on a puzzle that doesn't come together to make a picture I like to look at. I glue my puzzles together and put them on my wall, and I know other people do this too because they sell puzzle glue.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed explanation of the enjoyment and benefits of using their method to solve jigsaw puzzles. The OP may find the personal experience shared relatable and convincing, especially since it highlights how both strategies can be complementary in a group setting.",0
"So I've distilled what you wrote down to three points:

1) **Respect costs nothing.**
 
2) **Experience deserves respect.** 

3) **If you've proved yourself, you shouldn't need to prove yourself again.** (This is more what respect buys you than not needing to give respect, but it's related). 

Addressing these points: 

1) **If respect costs you nothing, why don't you respect everyone?** Assuming I'm a more junior, inexperienced person, why doesn't the experienced person respect me equally? Why do people spend so much time and money to earn credentials which are supposed to equate to respect in their fields?

The answer to these points is that respect does cost me something. We don't have the luxury, with our limited time on this planet, to evaluate all corners of a decision. When someone whom I respect tells me something, I rank it higher in my decision making process. That creates an opportunity cost corresponding with any other decisions I might have made. If that more experienced person was wrong, I've suffered in some way. People will take advantage of being respected to further themselves. Look at politicians or religious figures that charge large sums of money for speaking privileges etc. How I use my respect influences my limited resources including how I spend my time; it certainly isn't free.

2) If you accept my first point that respect does cost me something, then we have to assume it's a somewhat fixed resource. **If experience == respect, then I'd have no choice how to spend that respect.** Take two politicians who have been in office the same amount of time. Chances are, you respect one more than the other; why? 

Because one of them was likely right more or made decisions which you agreed with more. That means that not all experience is the same. There is some experience which is of higher quality than other experience. So let's say we work for the same company across teams and you've been around more than I have, you could say you've had more projects than I have, thus experience, but I've been right more. You've kept your business around, but it's limping more often than not. Is your experience as good as mine if I've been right a higher percentage? Should I defer to you? Heck, even if you were right as often as I was - I don't know your motives, the only ones I know are my own. The only experience I can truly count on is a shared personal experience, like working together over the years.

3) **If you only had to prove yourself once, you'd only ever have one assignment in school.** You'd only have one project at work before being promoted. A general would only have to fight one battle in war. You'd only have to go on a single date before being married. 

The reality is that you prove yourself over and over again, everyday. Athletes that were stars yesterday are duds tomorrow. Faithful spouses cheat. Bosses that pushed the boundaries of a business fail to adapt with the times. Respect make make it easier to prove yourself each time a challenge comes along, but you never stop. When you stop, you've already lost that respect. You've already proven you're not worthy.","&gt;Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers.

Yes, that is what young people are objecting to: the idea that simple time on the planet demands deference (by which I assume you mean that the older person's view is considered valid and reasonable unless proved false).

&gt;to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason

Well, let's distinguish groups for a moment.  Because as I see it, you're treating three groups as being the same thing.

(1).  People who have established themselves in the area they're discussing (so a professor of public health talking about Obamacare)

(2).  People who have established themselves in an unrelated area (a professor of physics talking about Obamacare)

(3).  People who are older but do not otherwise have establishing credentials.

Your argument seems to be that group (3) deserves deference because groups (1) and probably (2) deserve it.

&gt;Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.

But that experience would need to be relevant and established.  Otherwise your argument is that simply being alive is experience, and thus that age by itself is worthy of respect.

To wit, a 23-year-old law school student knows more about the dormant commerce clause than a sixty-year-old steel mill foreman.  The latter's life experience is irrelevant to that discussion.

&gt;2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.

Except your argument isn't a neutral version of respect where we accept that everyone can have a different opinion and there's really nothing age has to do with that.  Your argument is for *deference*, which would mean the younger person submits on the issue to the older person.  That *does* cost something if the issue is either (a) the younger person believes he has a better way to do things, or (b) the younger person believes he is right and the older person is wrong.

If that weren't true, you wouldn't be posting a CMV, since your logic says that you ""deferring"" to me costs you nothing.

&gt;Plenty of people ""proved themselves"" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to ""earn respect"".

And in cases where that's true, the person can say ""oh, and I also have my Ph.D in the subject we're discussing.""  Again, you're treating people with credentials and people without credentials like they're the same group.

&gt;Except the argument's merit can very be based on passed experience. Something older people generally have more of.

1.  Past experience, not passed.

2.  No, the merit of the argument is the merit of the argument.  And an argument based on ""I'm old and in my experience X is true"" is a meritless argument.",1,1,True,"Response 1 is more persuasive because it breaks down the points made by the OP and provides logical counterarguments to each one.

"Most of the really famous First To Do Whatever spots were claimed by white guys during a time when nobody could even *imagine* the idea that a non-white-guy would achieve something like that.  So celebrating the First Woman or First African-American To Do Whatever is less about the accomplishment itself (although the accomplishment may still be very impressive) and more about recognizing the personal and societal obstacles that had to be overcome.  

I think the big accomplishments of the future are going to be a lot less segregated.  We're going to celebrate the First Person On Mars one day, and maybe by then race and gender will be insignificant details instead of obstacles.","If someone sets a world record for the 400m sprint, that's impressive, yes? Let's say they're the first person to run that distance in X amount of time. A few other people run it in that time afterwards, but it's still a rare accomplishment. Let's imagine that a few years later, someone finishes the 400m sprint in X time while wearing a 50lb rucksack. Would you agree that that is a different accomplishment and should be celebrated on its own?

Being part of a socially disadvantaged group is the equivalent to sprinting while wearing a heavy rucksack.

Not only that, but people look for role models. If you're a straight while male, you have tons of role models. Want to be a scientist? Most scientists look just like you! So do most politicians! Want to be a belly dancer? It might not even occur to you that you *can* be a belly dancer - it probably never has - because you've never seen a belly dancer who looks like you. (I know straight while dudes who bellydance exist, but they aren't common.) No one is actively preventing you from being a belly dancer, but it's not something you're likely to try doing. If you did try, some belly dance schools might turn you away because you don't fit what they think a belly dancer should look like. 

Now imagine being black, or gay, or a woman. Or all three. There aren't any notable scientists who look like you. At least not many. Same for politicians. You know that lots of people don't like people like you, so they wouldn't give you grant money or vote for you even if you tried. It probably won't occur to you to try, and if it does, you'll see that no one who is like you has succeeded and you might give up. But if you can see that hey, there is a black lesbian senator, she looks just like me, she got votes, she got funding, she can do it! Then maybe you'll think, hey, I could do it too. 

So it's important that you know about that black lesbian senator, or you might decide to give up and be a belly dancer instead. ",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more detailed and relatable analogy to explain the importance of celebrating the accomplishments of individuals from socially disadvantaged groups.

"Remember, the argument that mass piracy preserves things assumes that hundreds of years from now we'll have technology which can read in and play back the same files we're pirating today. It's all well and good if we have thousands of hard drives remaining 600 years from now, each with the entirety of the GoT universe (books, TV show, lore, you name it) stored on it. However, if there aren't any computers (or other devices) available to play them back to you, those hard drives are essentially useless. To put it another way, it's like [that scene from Zoolander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2uHBhKTSe0) where they're trying to figure out how to access the files in the computer. If the files exist, then we technically have preserved them - but if we can't actually access them, then what's the point?

Part of the reason cave paintings have survived so well is because they're entirely intelligible even without any other knowledge of human culture. Monks' manuscripts from the middle ages are similar, in that they've preserved materials in a language we understand - but what happens in a thousand years where someone who has no knowledge of the English or Latin or Italian (etc.) languages or any way to get that knowledge stumbles upon those manuscripts? They'll have the really old stuff in tactile, tangible form, but they won't be able to access any of the information on it. Hard drives would be even worse - if you can't get into them and see the files stored there, they serve no purpose other than really old paperweight.

So, to answer your question: Is home recording/piracy an effective form of preservation? Sure. Is it the *most* effective, though? Absolutely not. If you really want to be able to store GoT effectively, paint the entire series on a cave wall somewhere.","&gt;At no point in history has it ever been easier to ensure archival and preservation due to digital mediums, and yet by applying copyright protections the content makers are doing nothing more than ensuring their great works might be lost to the ages.

Not really. Remeber HBO has acess to the same tech and the raw footage. For something as valuable as GOT its safe to assume that such techniques will be employed. On top of that there are all the quite legal DVD copies floating around. 

&gt;It's not too hard to believe something like this might be lost - only 46 years ago millions of people watched the moon landing on TV, but almost no one had the technical means to have their own recording of it. Here we are now with the original tapes missing - sure we have a recording, but think of how much better recordings we might have if (like today) people could have made their own high-end home recordings at least matching the quality of the original broadcast.

NASA material isn't protected by copyright. If anything the moon landings are a demonstration of your method not working.

&gt;A very similar story can be said about the missing Dr. Who epsiodes - of which some were recovered thanks to piracy

If by some you mean almost none then yes. A few 8mm cine clips. By comparison a single cupboard in the BBC turned up 3 complete episodes during a move. 

&gt;500+ years from now - I think the only copies of some uncommon films going to be some pirated copy taken out of a private archive, of which copyright protection had to be illegally circumvented to make.

Unlikely. Films don't take up much hard disc space by modern standardards so for the companies that hold the copyright keeping the things around has an effectively zero cost and well you never known when they might be useful. 

I think part of the problem is that you don't understand the problem areas of modern archiving. Individual TV series and films don't present much of a problem. The problem areas are:

1)Shear volume of data. Backing up the whole of youtube is tricky. The Square Kilometre Array should be able to produce about 10 petabytes of compressed data a day. I don't know about you but I don't keep petabyte hard drives about the place.

2)Non digital stuff. Some is fine. Clay tablets and Vellum can if stored correctly last pretty much forever nitrate film stock not so much. Pirates don't seem to spend much time digitalising nitrate film stock.

3)stuff that requires really specific hardware to function. MANE and MESS do their best but there are limits. Now in fairness those projects are partially piracy driven but it isn't mass piracy. Most people aren't interested in being able to run software for say an HEC2M (although I don't know if any software for that system survived) so the work tends to be done by a handful of rather obsessive people.
",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a clear and logical argument against the idea that mass piracy is the most effective form of preservation.

"While the benefits you mention are certainly a good thing to take into consideration when talking about the ethics of zoos, I feel that as long as a zoo is in possession of an animal that has demonstrated a degree of intelligence on par with toddlers, as many different species have, the benefits will be far outweighed by the downsides. Locking up a human toddler in a way too small cage just for education is an obvious no-go, so animals such as parrots, elephants, dolphins and chimpanzees which have all demonstrated high degrees of intelligence and emotions should never be kept in a cage. As long as they are, a zoo can *not* be considered ethical. Many of these animals are demonstrably miserable in captivity and will lead lives far inferior to the lives they would lead in either the wild or in wild-like conditions. As long as we can not provide these conditions to them we should never lock them up.

Not to mention zoos break up family groups of animals which have demonstrated strong social bonds such as orcas and elephants, to sell the babies to other zoos. This is scarring the animals emotionally to the point where the animals will grief for long periods of time. This is not only heartbreaking but also unethical.","I think the bottom line is if none of the animals held captive in the zoo are sentient/sapient/self aware/ then it can't be moral, but if only non sentient/sapient/self aware/ animals are held captive then it can be. 

Just think of it as though aliens kept you captive in their zoo. Are there any conditions that would justify that? Not really. But on the other side of the spectrum, it doesn't matter what you do with a fly. 

I know I could debate until the end of time with some people about which animals do and don't apply for person rights, and you could argue that since humans are not on the same page about that, then zoos are unethical, but the reality is that we can know which animals are at risk of deserving person rights, and which are not, and there are far fewer animals that do, than don't. 

So, zoos could still work. But no orcas, no dolphins, no otters, no cephalopods, no ravens, no parrots, no elephants, no monkeys or apes.

"To assume that you must act, though, assumes that you are working toward a set of common goals.  In the instance of a woman being attacked in an alley, you can safely assume that you, she, and nearly all of society agree that she needs to be helped.  You haven't really injected your own morals into the situation, because it's reasonable to assume that she WANTS your help, and that you've clearly identified the good and bad in the situation.

In more complex matters, though, such as the conflict in the middle east, it isn't so clear-cut.  Looking at Israel and Palestine, for example, there is a lot of disagreement regarding who is right and wrong, and what the actual solution is.

"Voting for Sanders in a primary and Sanders winning the primary are two separate things.

Depending on your state, you can (likely) vote for Sanders without a worry that he will actually win the primary over Clinton.  While that won't put Sanders in the White House, it does demonstrate for future races that there are ideologically sympathetic people **willing to come out and vote in the primaries**, encouraging them to run for lesser, more achievable races (Local / State / Congressional), allowing them to build up a stronger overall base that wouldn't get swept in the General.  This is similar to how the Tea Party has gained a great deal of power despite not having a ""Tea Party President"" or even winning the 2012 Republican primaries; ideologically sympathetic people showed up to vote into primaries and won many Local / State / Congressional seats.

That means that progressives would vote for him in force, and even if he loses a lot of the democratic minority in congress would be more progressive than they are now. Then, after 4-8 years of a Republican presidency, a brand new democratic challenger arises, will likely win, and will be forced to the left during primaries so that a repeat of 2016 wouldn't happen.

"I'm just starting out hunting, and I've taken some small game, but I don't do it just to see something die, and I hope I never do. I do it because I like the food, I like being outdoors, I like knowing my meat was harvested as painlessly as possible, and in the U.S. it helps prevent habitat destruction by both funding conservation and managing populations that have had their natural predators removed by human intrusion and poor hunting practices prior to the current system. I want future generations to see whitetail deer, water fowl, and wild turkeys, and  can help preserve them by hunting responsibly, while getting some free range organic food out of it.

"Many people here have noted that public decency laws often make an exception for nursing, I will try to address why these exceptions make sense to have.

The problem with nursing mothers seems to bee that onlookers might feel uncomfortable in seeing a normally sexualized body part. Since the breast of a nursing mother is shown in a clearly non-sexual context the discomfort at seeing it should be minimized already. On the other hand babies need food regularly, to limit where a parent can breastfeed is also to limit how much time they can spend in public. So from this I conclude that any law against public breastfeeding would harm parents far more than it would benefit onlookers.

You also mention accommodating public nudity, but we already accommodate otherwise unacceptable behaviors in the name of child rearing. We already accept that parents will take up extra space, will discipline their children, and have their children inconvenience others. Since children are integral to society and they are near impossible to bring up without disturbing others we make exceptions for them, letting their parents feed them everywhere would just be part of this tradition.","&gt; However, that doesn't change the fact that the laws exist, and are the basis of my argument.

The laws that exist *explicitly* allow breastfeeding. Not all nudity is the same.

&gt;  I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things.

It *is* too much to ask, and that's why these laws exist. Going to a bathroom is uncomfortable and unsanitary. Pumping milk doesn't get everything out, there are transportation (cooling) concerns, and some infants reject the bottle. You can't schedule nursing, so not allowing public breastfeeding relegates mothers to the home.

&gt; No one else is obligated to accommodate public nudity. If it's not ""convenient"" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood.

Everybody is obligated to accommodate it because that's the law. If it's not ""convenient"" for you to not stare like a pervert, that's all part of living in a modern society where people accept reproduction.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more thorough and logical argument for why public breastfeeding should be allowed, addressing both the discomfort of onlookers and the necessity for parents to be able to feed their children in public. It also brings up the point that society already makes accommodations for parents in other ways, so allowing public breastfeeding would be consistent with that. Response 1, on the other hand, focuses more on the existence of laws and the inconvenience to others without addressing the core reasons for allowing public breastfeeding.",0
"Nobody is saying fetuses aren't alive. They are. They just should not be considered as *independent* organisms that are subject to moral principles. My hand is 'alive' in the same sense as a fetus is, but that doesn't mean cutting it off is the same as killing a person or animal. People often say fetuses develop into humans in time, therefore they are humans, but this does not account for the fact that they require the mother's body to do so. A zygote does not 'naturally' develop into a human without outside influence. 

&gt;When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality.

When you get in a car and drive somewhere, you know it's a possibility that some idiot may crash into you, regardless of how careful you are. Does that mean you implicitly 'accept' all the personal injuries and damages that result? If so, why should you get medical treatment to minimize these effects?","&gt; I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it).

What do you mean by alive? From a biological perspective, a fetus is definitely alive, as is anything made up of cells. When you say alive, are you referring to consciousness? 

For me, whether or not it is ""wrong"" to kill a fetus is basically dependent on whether or not the fetus values its own life (i.e. wants to stay alive/wants to not die). For me, this makes the question pretty clear cut throughout most of pregnancy. You need to be able to think (i.e. have a mind) to value your own life, and all evidence points to the necessity of brain activity in order to think. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that a fetus must have brain activity in order for it to value its own life (and by extension for it to be wrong to kill the fetus). Before about 24 weeks, a fetus doesn't have brain activity, so I assume that it doesn't value its life at least during those first 24 weeks, and that it is acceptable to kill it. Even when a fetus does develop brain activity, that doesn't mean that it will value its own life, but it's much easier to draw a line at existence/nonexistence of brain activity.

&gt;I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. 

I think that the ""person's right to do what they want with their body"" argument is pretty ridiculous. I think this because (1) if you don't believe that a fetus is a person with a right life, then that argument really doesn't matter anyway because killing the fetus is OK (2) if you believe that a fetus is a person with a right to life, that argument essentially says that when person X's continued existence is sufficiently dependent on person Y, and person Y finds person X's continued existence inconvenient, they're allowed to kill X. 

&gt;I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain.

Call me hyperrational, but I think that that rational conclusions should not be swayed when you realize that they are hard to live with. They should only be changed when you encounter something that alters your base assumptions or when you realize that your reasoning was faulty. If you change your beliefs based on what advances your interests, then you might as well just stop attempting to justify them rationally in the first place.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a clear analogy that highlights the idea that just because something is a possibility, it doesn't mean individuals implicitly accept all consequences that result.

"&gt;  if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

The major distinction I see here is that race, gender, sexuality, etc., those are all things that a person can't control those things about themselves. You can't decide not to be black or a woman or gay or whatever for a while because you're around people who don't like those types of people. You can try and hide it or downplay that part of you, but (at least for race and gender) those are characteristics about you that are immediately visible, permanent, and part of you. 

Speech is different. You don't ever *have* to speak. If you believe strongly that the Holocaust didn't happen, that doesn't mean that whenever you walk by a synagogue you automatically and uncontrollably start spewing out anti-Semitic comments. Speech is an action, whereas race or gender are not actions but qualities of a person which they can't reasonably change.

That's a fundamental difference."," if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech?

This is why people struggle with free speech. 

The short answer is no. You can say whatever you want. You can't however say what you want and expect others not to react to your words. I can't go to my friends house and say that his wife is a cunt and expect to be invited over next week. I can't tell my employer that I feel that black people are inferior to whites and then expect to represent my boss by wearing his company's name badge to work.

Research also indicated that such a temperature difference makes a massive difference in the amount of time needed for said coffee to cause burns and therefore the dangers associated with the drink.

Such a difference between McDonald's coffee and other coffee in the city means that a customer has a reasonable expectation for coffee at any given restaurant to be in a similar range of temperature.  By exceeding that range, McDonald's was giving the customer that had a significantly increased risk of injury associated with it without any warning that theirs was different from similar products in other places.","&gt; McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F

"Grey is the simultaneous coexistence of things deemed good and bad. From a consequentialist perspective grey will occur when multiple values are affected by an action. Let's say that happiness and truth for humans are both intrinsically good. Smiling to make someone happy is always good as long as it's always as long as it doesn't take away from other things of value. When you have to deny one value to create another, things become grey. Telling someone a painful truth promotes human truth but decreases human happiness. We sometimes call these ""moral dilemmas"" when the magnitude of the values are similar or ""necessary evils""/"" lesser of two evils "" when the magnitudes are obviously different. Considered in isolation actions can be see clearly as good or bad for each value, but in real moral systems there can be dozens of values competing. We value things like happiness, truth, liberty, piety, life, and duty, each in multiple nuanced ways. When you try to apply them all to your life, everything will start to look grey.","The Universe can't be divided into good and bad because 'good' and 'bad' are just descriptions of how parts of that universe, interact with humans on a subjective level.



By that I mean that 'bad' means about the same thing as 'soft', or 'warm to the touch'. Warmth and the softness of something is really just a description of the subjective feeling that object has in its interaction with humans. 

We can express this interaction in more complex ways, and we can measure and relate this feeling to other, less subjective criteria, like:temperature for warmth and coefficient of friction/ and description of material surface and its interaction with other materials. 

But in the end, we're just relating two physical properties of bits of the Universe, with the subjective feeling that we experience, as a physical organism.


Now the above examples are much more wishy-washy, because of the fact that something like warmth *is* able to be objectively measures by an accurate outside source, like temperature. Good and bad are just the two general categories of 'responses' that we lump things in. Getting stung by a bee feels bad, and causes pain, swelling and a sometimes dangerous interaction with an outside chemical that you're body has a conditioned, negative-reinforcing experience to.

Most people would be comfortable in firmly putting 'being stung by a bee' under the 'bad' response category. But what about something more complex, and subtle? Like a tickle? The exact same sensation could be pleasurable, infuriating, hilarious, sexual, annoying and downright maddening, all based on the (very,very,very) complex interactions happening in your brain, which we call consciousness.


Is tickling bad, or good? Well answering which category to put that in could be either an easy choice, or a very difficult one, depending on any brains subjective and unique experience of it.




From these examples we can see how the idea that there is no middle ground between good and bad, is comparable (and in some ways I'd say, much *more* incorrect) than saying something like ""There is no middle ground between cold and hot"". 

Of course there are things so hot you'd physically be unable to experience them without instantly rendering your mushy and organic sense organs useless and dead, and of course there are things so cold that it would instantly begin killing and freezing any sensing cells it came into contact with.


But isn't it also obvious that, due to the fact that the transition between warmth and cold is a continuous scale, and the criteria is inherently subjective (Note: I'm talking about warmth, as in the sensation, which while highly correlated to temperature, is not the same thing), than the same must be true for good and bad, and thus there exists a very large grey area while attempting to jam everything into those two categories.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a clear and structured explanation of how moral dilemmas arise when multiple values are affected by an action, leading to the existence of grey areas in morality.

"The Southern Poverty Law Center [tracks 939 hate groups across the United States](http://www.businessinsider.com/active-hate-groups-by-state-2014-2). It's hard to say exactly how many people are in these groups, but even if each has an average membership of only 30, that's nearly 30,000. On top of this, there are no doubt millions of serious racists or other sorts of bigots or other people with extreme views who don't belong to organized groups.

Yet despite these millions of people having ideas that we might think would cause them to want to shoot up black churches, bomb synagogues, or assassinate abortion doctors, these sorts of things are fairly rare.

That suggests that merely holding these ideas is *not* sufficient cause for a person of sound mind, who is at least vaguely socialized within mainstream society, to go out and kill people. Therefore, in the rare cases where that *does* occur, there must be some other proximate cause.

From a business POV, it is beneficial to ensure diversity. From a social POV, it is beneficial to ensure one gender is not severely underrepresented at decision making levels, and to ensure that young girls can have role models in the same way young boys can.

See the documentary [Miss Representation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1784538/) for some further discussion on this (it's on Netflix).","Underrepresentation is a symptom of problems, which is why it gets attention.Basically, there's no ""good"" reason why there would be a gender disparity in STEM fields.

And if you never even get to the point of thinking about stuff like that, how do you define it as homosexuality in the first place?  Homosexuality *is* the lusting after members of the same gender.

So while I would be more inclined to agree that homosexuality is no more or less of a sin than non-reproductive-oriented heterosexuality, I don't see how you could claim that homosexuality isn't a sin at all.","Well, yea.

There is a large and growing number of Christians, including religious leaders, theologians, historians, and whole denominations, who don't think a universal and eternal condemnation of all same gender relationships is an accurate understanding or appropriate application of scripture.

"The books experienced a very significant change in pace after the third book. Regardless of whether you liked them or hated them, they introduced many new characters in multiple new regions, had to catch up with all of the previous characters, and provided more backstory about the world that was essential to understanding all of the plotting and magic that was going on. The last two books had a lot of jobs to do involving introduction, and the introductory parts of characters are rarely the most interesting (especially in a series where the audience can take multiple seasons to warm up to characters).

Frankly, that scene in the books was still rape (if you give a 13-year-old girl to the general of a massive barbarian army and have her try and say no, it's probably not going to work), so the books don't stand up comparatively. The rape even served a purpose, highlighting the starting point of Dany's journey from powerless to powerful. Cersei's rape in the show wasn't even supposed to be a rape (just a thoroughly appalling sex scene), so I hope we can chalk that up to bad editing. The most recent rape scene is still too fresh to fairly judge (for all we know, it works perfectly into the context of the rest of the season). 

Staging: There are definitely notable uses of good staging, but I will admit that Game of Thrones can be lackluster in this respect more often that I'd like. To be fair, Game of Thrones does strive for a certain level of realism (as best as a show with dragons and zombies can). The prosaic staging could be seen as adherence to this guideline, with the director not distorting our perceptions of the characters to make the fantasy world seem more mundane and relatable.

Dialogue: Yeah, they can't all be winners. The writers for the show have to deal with a massive handicap though: they need to convey the books' storyline and characters, when their main viewing audience has the attention span of a goldfish. Maybe you didn't suffer from this, but among the show watchers I know, if a character doesn't show up for a few episodes, they will likely forget their name (if they even knew it in the first place). It's so much harder to keep track of all of the character names, faces, and relationships when you can't flip back through the text to see who's who, and the dialogue has to do a lot of the heavy lifting to make these things understandable to the mass audience. This is basically a necessary consequence of a big budget adaption. If it helps, pretend the modern idioms are part of a Translation Convention.

Character's Appearance: There are plenty of characters with long hair and plenty more with beards. A lot of the book descriptions would just be comical if you tried to use them straight (Targaryen purple eyes, Daario's blue beard, hyper-blonde Lannisters).

Plot's Movement: The problem isn't that they're cutting a lot out that was in the books; there was a TON of non-plot relevant stuff in the books in the first place (even weeding that out is still a lot). This is absolutely a necessary consequence of an adaptation. Non-book readers have no idea how fast they're moving comparatively. The show also occasionally has to check in on characters that haven't showed up in a while, even if they're not doing anything plot important, just so viewers don't forget they exist (goldfish memory). This is why Yara keeps popping up, even though she's done nothing of consequence since season 2. Finally, the first half of every season always tends to be set up. Season 4 is the lucky exception because it basically picked up in the middle of the most intense part of the entire book series, so this season probably feels exceptionally slow coming after that.



","&gt; They are using the ""best"" books in the last two decades so of course the show is popular.

I'm not quite sure what the quotes around best are meant to imply, so maybe I'm preaching to the choir here, but I think you'll have a tough time finding that many folks who are that Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons were even close to the top books in the past decade. I liked them personally, but I know quite a few people who quit reading around book 4. And there's really not much about those books that screams ""make a tv show about me"". Its about horrible things happening to children, has a HUGE cast, spans multiple continents, has main characters that never meet each other, etc... A lot of things that work great in books have a huge degree of difficulty adapting to TV. So however you feel about the fins product, I think the creators deserve at least a little more credit than you're giving them.

&gt;But if someone without their rapey suckage had control, could it be that much better?

So, I do want to ask... How much of your frustration is based on the end of the last episode, plus a handful of other scenes throughout the series? I think the show is awesome, but I absolutely think they've done a poor job depicting certain topics. Mileage may vary as to what extent these issues sour ones enjoyment of the show as a whole.

"I'll try a different approach than the typical ""it'll take longer than 20 years.""

With all automated mechanical systems, it's important to have fail-safes to allow human intervention in the case of emergencies that are not anticipated by the software.  

Nowadays, auto-pilot can fly airlines pretty much from gate-to-gate.  The reason that we don't do this is that the software cannot anticipate **all** possible emergency situations and pilot intuition cannot be replaced.  

I believe the same thing will ring true with self-driving cars.  Eventually, they will take over a majority of our driving, but I think that it'll be a long time before we have self-driving cars that cannot be manually controlled.  
","While I agree with you that safe-driving cars will likely eventually become mainstream, I'm not sure where you got your time line from because it seems grossly exaggerated.

"I was reading the other day that even Snowden actually isn't asking for a pardon to return to the USA. I mean, I am sure he would take one, but that isn't what he is asking for.

Whistleblower laws in the US allow for people to break the law by revealing government information, and avoid punishment if they can show they did so for the purpose of the public good. The problem for Snowden is that these laws explicitly exclude intelligence agencies, and that under the Espionage Act he is charged with, he cannot make a public good defense.

Snowden has said repeatedly that he would come back and face trial if he were allowed to defend himself as a whistleblower in court. So the government doesn't even need to pardon him to get him to return from Russia - simply charge him under something less draconian and anachronistic than the Espionage Act, and let him make his defense.

"Here's a big point on homeschooling that no one has mentioned yet: Military families. 

My dad was active duty military when I was growing up and as a result we moved 10 times before I turned 13. If we hadn't been homeschooling then that would have meant changing school every 8 to 18 months. Many times these moves took place during the conventional school year, so homeschooling meant that we could keep up with our curriculum even though we we're moving to a different state while the normal school year was still in session.

Switching from one public school to another one in a different state during the school year would have been chaos because of the state curriculum differences. Homeschooling meant we could keep and maintain a consistent curriculum when we couldn't have otherwise. ","I went to public school then switched to a very highly ranked private school.  The difference in opportunity is insane.  I took more AP classes per year than the public schools even offered - and I didn't come close to taking all of the AP classes at my school.

"This isnt the first time the internet has fallen in love with a politician.

"Let me hit you with a dash of my philosophy, tell me what you think.

Are all animal lives of equal value? If the answer is yes, then all animals should be treated equally. Zoos offer preferential treatment to certain animals, therefore they are not offering equal treatment to all animals, and are unethical.

If your answer is no, then what determines an animal's life's worth? What criteria are used to decide which animals deserve to be kept in zoos and which are not? 

Generally, the more endangered a species is, the more likely it is to be found in a zoo. But species have been going extinct since long before humans were around, nature does this on its own. So zoos are in direct conflict with the natural order of life. So zoos = humans manipulating nature. We do this all the time, but generally for a practical purpose: e.g. living space, food, clothing, etc...

Considering that zoos are open to the public for general pleasure, and are only found in cities, they serve a purpose as entertainment. Is using an animal for entertainment ethical? 

Compare a zoo with a wildlife preserve, which is not designed for easy public access and provides a large space for endangered species to roam freely and reproduce naturally. A zoo then, is an artificial environment that only exists to provide us with entertainment. A wildlife preserve, with human assistance, would be more ethical than a zoo, as its purpose would be practical.

So a zoo is unethical, because it doesn't serve its purported purpose as well as other means. 

**tl;dr: Zoos discriminate against some animals, and use them solely for entertainment. If preservation is the real goal, there are more efficient ways to do so. As it stands, a zoo is just a place in the city where you can see animals not native to your region for fun.**","My thoughts on this...

1. Philosophically, I would disagree with putting primates in zoos since, as our closest relatives, they are very intelligent and behave a lot like us to the point that I consider them people. Bonobos are also already not allowed in zoos because they fuck all the time.

2. Piggybacking off my first point, there are also a lot of others that are intelligent enough to realize that life kinda sucks for them contained in a zoo all their lives. I can't imagine putting my cat or dog in one.

3. I would only agree with putting intelligent animals in zoos if it is primarily to preserve their species. A zoo is practically the only place where they would be given warmth and comfort.

Of course, the problem with all my points that that, where do we draw the line on intelligence? How do we know if an animal is dissatisfied with his/her life in the zoo? I'm not totally against zoos, but liveliness and health should come first for everyone in them.",2,2,True,"Response 2 presents a strong argument against the ethics of zoos by highlighting the preferential treatment of certain animals, the conflict with the natural order of life, and the comparison with wildlife preserves. It also questions the use of animals for entertainment purposes, which can be a compelling ethical concern.",0
"I think your premise that blood transfusions are safe is your biggest fallacy. When preformed by a medical professional, transfusions are very safe. However, when professional organizations do not forbid them they are tacitly endorsing them. This may not be a problem for the professionals who can afford medical professionals and sterile materials, but the kids who are trying to get to that professional level will almost certainly NOT have access to those benefits. They are the ones who will be forced to take risks.   
  
And your argument that it's going to happen anyway so we should not ban it is logically inconsistent. That is like saying people are going to steal cars, so we shouldn't have a law forbidding it. Just because some people do not obey the rules is not an argument that they shouldn't exist. In addition, those people violating the rules take on the additional risk of getting caught.

"The Totino's little party pizzas are wonderful. They are admittedly horrible, but they are also wonderfully horrible. It's like a train wreck in your mouth. 

Little Ceasars is also far from the worst pizza you can find from a pizzeria. I stumbled into a place in Chicago that appeared to have not known the difference between salt and sugar when making their sauce. Side note from another place: If you are going to put out garlic salt instead of garlic powder... warn us. 

Little Ceasars, Dominoes, Pizza Hut etc. are all mediocre pizza places. Most chains are. But there are definitely some places that long to serve pizza, really longing to have a pizza because they have only heard of them by rough description. 

For frozen if you look at the Jacks/ Tombstone/ Red Baron types... these are absolutely what you are talking about. Light on the cheese, heavy on the lack of taste. 

These also sell for about $3 a pie. The cost of a slice at a good place. 

But you want to move up in quality. So you think Di'giorno or Freschetta.. but these are made by the same companies as the shitty ones listed above with the same idea... which is to make pizza really cheap. Most pizza toppings also don't survive freezing very well. Which is why there is a lot of compromise in quality. 

However if you are in a store that puts a lot of effort and branding into their store brand (Wegmans in the northeast comes to mind)... their frozen pizza, and all of their store branded items are made to re-enforce the brand of the store. Which is why their name is all over the packaging instead of having an ""Exclusive brand"" like ""Everyday essentials"". 

Those are going to be the frozen pizzas that have the best chance of not just being a decent frozen meal, but also being a decent pizza. Different from a pizzeria but just as good on a quality scale. (The aforementioned Wegmans pizzas always struck me as a little floury and not as greasy as the closest pizzerias to me growing up. But very close to one of the upscale pizzerias I found on Chicago's Michigan Avenue)

You might want to also look into picking up a frozen pizza (mailed directly to you) from Chicagos ""Giordanos"". It is as close as I've come to getting good pizzeria quality pizza from frozen. Also about the same cost as getting it in the store.

You're not going to get a NYC pizzeria quality pie from frozen though. The hand tossed dough etc. just isn't replicable in the large scale assembly line demanded by frozen. But then again.. you're not going to get that NYC quality in most of the country from a pizzeria anyway.

"The Afghanistan War was fought to protect your freedom.

Which freedoms? The freedom to not be bombed by terrorists on your home soil, kidnapped while traveling abroad and beheaded, the freedom to travel on airplanes and boats across the skies and seas without fear of terrorist hijacking, etc. (We'll say these are your Ninth Amendment Rights.)

Without question, the American invasion of Afghanistan severely crippled Al-Qaeda and Taliban terrorists. Many of their leadership and gruntmen were killed outright or shipped off to Gitmo and detained without due process. However you may feel about that, the fact that this war caused much of the terrorists focused on attacking the West to live in caves carved into roadless, desolate provinces *undoubtedly* affected their ability to bomb your plane/ship, kidnap you, behead you, etc.

They were very active prior to the American invasion, including September 11 attacks, USS Cole bombing of 2000, and the US Embassy attacks in 1998 throughout East Africa.

"Well there's nothing wrong with the act of eating meat itself. What's typically thought to be wrong about meat-eating is the suffering inflicted upon animals as part of industrial farming. If we were to reform our practices around meat-eating, however, and do away with these objectionable conditions, it's possible to to satisfy your first condition, to hold that eating meat is permissible.

For the second, we just need to hold, quite reasonably, that animals have rights against being harmed and that non-consensual sex is a harm. Both of these are pretty straightforward given how we view the torture of animals and rape.

I suppose what puzzles you is the apparent tension between saying ""it's OK to kill an animal and eat it"" and ""but animals have rights against being harmed."" This tension can be resolved if death turns out not to be a harm for the one who dies. Now this is actually a fairly tenable view. Consider some paradigmatic cases of harm: you break your leg, you're robbed, or you're psychologically abused. Something every case of harm seems to have in common is that the harm involves a comparison your state of being before and after the harming event. So when you break your leg you're worse off than you were before breaking your leg in virtue of the pain and hindered motion that you experience. If you're robbed you're worse off than you were before the robbing in virtue of being deprived of whatever was stolen. If you're psychologically abused, then you're worse off in virtue of the change in your mental well-being. So harm involves a comparison between how you were before the harming event and how you were after it. Given this comment element it's reasonable to define harm in comperative terms. So something like ""S is harmed by event X if and only if S is made worse off than they were with X having happened.""

Now when we try to conceive of death as a harm we run into a problem. Namely, there is no ""you after death"" to compare to. So before death you were x, y, and z, but after death you are non-existent. Since there's nothing to compare to, we can't count death as a harm on the comparative account that I gave above. Perhaps there's some other way to make sense of death as a harm for the one who has died or perhaps death is only bad for people who cared about the deceased and have had their own interests frustrated by her death. I'm not going to come down on either side of this debate here, but the latter is at least a reasonable approach to take and if it's correct then we can coherently say of animals that it's OK to kill them, but not OK to harm them.

Does that make sense?","Under the moral framework of rational self-interest, objectivism, virtue-value ethics, or Aristotelian ethics eating meat of animals is good because it gives us sustenance, and the *means* are justified as we have rights over beings that don't have the potential for free will or rational thought.

"I mean, I know a lot of Vietnamese-Americans who were refugees from South Vietnam who probably would have preferred the other side winning. So I don't think you're alone, but I think perhaps you're assuming that had the American backed South won, these problems would be fixed. I know you said the North was corrupt, but the South was every bit as corrupt. They probably wouldn't have been able to support the economy any better, and depressions and famine may have ensued anyway, albeit they may get support from the US. Remember that a significant number of Vietcong in the South were southerners who were disillusioned with the corruption of the government. So they in effect fueled quite a lot of backlash against themselves. I'd also point out that the government was rather unstable, as seen in the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. If there was that much turnover, there could potentially be wars in the future over other rival factions or even communist resurgence or a probable and continual insurgency. So there's a significant potential that more Vietnamese would die in the coming years than the already horrible toll paid. Also, if the DRVN won the war, I highly doubt they'd be able to solve the border dispute between Vietnam and China considering those countries have been at odds for centuries if I'm not mistaken. My point here is that unfortunately the choice between a good government and a bad government appears to have been an illusion, and while unfortunately the current government isn't good, I guess you might say it's ""the devil you know"", considering things could have gone worse.","1) Do you know how brutal, corrupt, and undemocratic South Vietnam is? Ngô Đình Diệm isn't democratically elected, instead he was assumed the presidency by the American to a country largely make up by the remnant of French imperialism (a puppet state). He's also not popular either, remember Vietnam supposed to be unified in 1954 after Điện Biên Phủ, and supposed to hold democratic election in 1956 as a result of the Geneva Accord... Guess who would have won that if it is actually held? That's right, Hồ Chí Minh had the overwhelming support of the nation. Not because he is a communist/socialist figure, but rather a NATIONALIST one

Back to the period of Diem's rule, the government is largely consist of his family members holding key positions (gia dình tr). Also, there are huge oppression toward the Bhuddism commnunity, led to the self-immolation of some certain Bhuddist monk that you should know. Also, there were many wrongful incarceration/execution of people who are suspected to be Communists or spy from the North. Likewise, villagers are force to move into camps/fortresses to avert any uprising... These policies causing lots of oppositions from the people and thus Diem was murdered.. What happened after that was a two-year spans of political instability, and the country couldn't even control itself... Hence, the Americans forces had to involve, which coincide with Nguyen Van Thieu's rule (and he's merely a puppet in a gov't whose policies were largely dictated by the Americans)...

My point is that how could a government that unstable could actually controlled Vietnam. Lacking of integrity from the interior and strength to cope with outside forces... The result of the War largely reflects the nature of South Vietnam, a mere puppet state which shouldn't be there at first place 

2) You think that the American wanted the best for us? Well, do you understand the nature of the Cold War, a global-scale tension which Vietnam was reluctantly dragged into. Most Vietnamese couldn't associated their War within the Cold War concept, virtually because we're from the ""hottest"" spot, which overshadowed the Cold War itself. My point is the US had their own interest to stop the power of the USSR, thus they called ""spread of Communism"", and they went radical about it. Many democratic elected  socialist leaders were overthrow by the US army and replaced by anti-communism despot, most notably in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) or [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). (Different circumstance but don't forget [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee)). Vietnam War shared the same nature with these but much more intensify because of the [Domino Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory)

3) About OP &amp; Vietnam: ~~You're part of the bandwagon who want to gaze war with China to demand the islands back. How ignorance you are!~~ This is not XII century when you could easily declare war upon one another. If we do attack China, not will we suffer their reprimand, but will receive criticism around the world. Diplomacy is the key, stronger collaboration between ASEAN and the US forces would keep the Chinese in the current place. 

I can't believe you despise the Vietnamese gov't because of Communism. It's a fail economic model that Vietnam got rid of in 1986. The party retain the name for historical reason, and more importantly, its nature is NATIONALIST, and a political platform for all people. [One-party system is totally democratic if you keep different opinions among its memebers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOsjSKKPWMc). If you think multi-party platform could work in Vietnam, then consider what happen in South Vietnam during the war, and how they set up a dictatorship after. 

You should remember that Vietnam is war-free in 1989, so its economy has short time to recover and develop. Compare Vietnam economy to Korea's and Japan's one disregard circumstances is just compare apple to orange. Remember that the war would be completely averted in [1945](http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=228) and [1954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conference_%281954%29).

"The idea of a single, normative Islam is not a helpful construction to someone on the outside who wishes to treat Islam academically. Typically, all we require is self-identification as Muslim, and then the person defines _his_ Islam.

We try not to sign off on particular versions as authentic or real, and instead try to present the history, the branches, etc. Islamism finds itself on the tree of Islam when Islam is treated academically, and the idea that we couldn't somehow trace it back to the roots, that it would clearly be shown to be inauthentic, seems implausible.

If it's really to be treated academically, the message will be chaos. I'd like to compare it to my first steps into studying Christianity academically. I had a single view of Christianity in mind and believed that it was essentially straightforward, although there were minor wobbles. Catholics killed lots, Martin Luther saved us, and then America.

I reacted in horror when I finally dug into Christianity academically. Not only were there Catholics, but there were Orthodox. And people who didn't think Jesus was God. And unitarians. And universalists. There were churches in Ethiopia and there were monophysites and diopho-whatevers. There were Chinese Christians who had some pretty weird views. Ebionites, which sounded racist. And God knows what relationship God, the Jews, and Christians are supposed to have.

It was chaos. An academic study of a religion rarely reveals a single, pure source. This is true in Islam too - few generations after the Prophet, the ummah is already split. And today it still is. Not just Sunni/Shia. There are also Ahmaddiya/Qadiani, who to outsiders are indistinguishible. There are four major schools of fiqh. And maybe this is the isnad for the use of the miswak during fasting, or maybe it's a pile of spaghetti.

... and all of this plays directly into the hands of the Islamist. The average person will recoil from all the choice he's just been presented. All the Islamist has to do is present his purified, simple version, and he's saved the day. The average person does not want, cannot tolerate, cannot sustain so much complexity. The Islamist message is appealing _because_ it gives straightforward, unambiguous answers that do not require three pages of footnotes, even if they're wrong.

You want thinkers, but you cannot turn your average person into a ""thinker."" This is not an insult - I've taught hundreds of good people, many of whom nevertheless fail to master any significant level of critical thinking. I know that most people fail not because of capacity, but because their environment does not afford them the sort of leisure they need. They have families. They have jobs.

Besides, the West coming in to teach the Muslim world its faith... the audacity of the idea is breathtaking. Even if we were best positioned to do it, we'd hardly be the best positioned to do it. The backlash would probably invalidate the entire project.

I'm not saying it wouldn't help for the average Muslim to know more about his religion. Any bit of extra knowledge anywhere would help. But simply because #1) military interventions haven't worked and #2) an educated populace would be nice, doesn't mean this is a workable solution.","&gt; Education should be at the grass roots level

That goes against your entire plan, It is not the responsibility of the west to ""educate"" muslims, That approach has resulted in nothing by continuous infantilization of muslims, treating them like irresponsible children that have no control over their own decisions.

&gt; A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism

Interpretation of religious texts does magically yield liberal ideals. There are more Islamic scholars, more educated literate muslims now then there have ever been in the history of Islam.  Islamism does not only grow from fertile soil of ignorance, It is a coherent set of ideologies that has a wide support of both the uneducated masses and highly educated politicized muslims.

Here's a better solution: Stop coddling muslims, stop thinking it is the responsibility of the west to ""westernize"" the muslim world. 

Personally I think religion is bad, I'd prefer to see a world with no religion, If you manage to somehow read into the life of Muhammad and make that work in your head with a liberal point of view, That's awesome, But thinking you somehow got there because you have a more ""correct"" or ""enlightened"" understanding of his life is utter nonsense.
",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a detailed and nuanced argument about the complexities of studying religion academically, highlighting the diversity within Islam and how this complexity can be exploited by Islamists. The response also addresses the limitations of trying to educate Muslims from a Western perspective. On the other hand, Response 2 takes a more confrontational approach, advocating for a stop to Western intervention and suggesting that a greater understanding of Islam is not incompatible with Islamism without providing much evidence or reasoning.",0
"In your analogy, the guy who hacks off his own leg is permanently crippled.  He may regret his decision but there's nothing he can do about it, his leg is still gone.  He can't get it back no matter how much he tries, it's just gone.

Being obese (in most cases) is not just a 'well they did it to themself' but rather the result of an ongoing series of self-destructive choices ('they are continuing to do it to themself').  The obese person (generally) only stays obese through a continued lifestyle of bad diet and low exercise.  This is a choice they make every time they pick up a McLardBurger.  If the obese person improved their diet and started exercising, their weight would improve and they would no longer be disabled.

Therefore, we can say that an obese person is *continually choosing to be disabled* and thus shouldn't be afforded the same benefits as someone who does not have a choice.

Let me make an analogy here- **let's say I tied a rope around my legs and handcuffed myself behind my back.  I then claim that I am disabled** and I need a wheelchair and someone to push me around and spoon feed me because I am unable to do these things.  **Would you support spending tens of thousands of dollars to pay for my wheelchair and an aide?**  
No of course not, because I am only 'disabled' by choice and I can choose to become un-disabled whenever I want.  Therefore while my present situation may require accommodations, *by choosing not to correct that situation I am also choosing to require those accommodations*.  This is little different than parking in a handicap spot because I'm too lazy to walk across the parking lot- handicap accommodations are for people who are handicapped by illness or injury, not people who choose to reduce their own capabilities.

The correct solution for someone like this not to spend $10k+ on wheelchairs and aides and whatnot, it's to give them the tools they need to improve their own situations-  a handcuff key and a pair of scissors will do nicely.  Or if you want to go REALLY hands on, un-handcuff them and then cut the rope for them.

-----

**Let's take a couple of similar analogies to illustrate.**

My job involves just talking on the phone, and I'm really really lazy.  I sit in bed all day talking on the phone, never moving an inch.  As a result my muscles atrophy and i'm now extremely weak.  Do I have the right to demand that self-closing doors have their tension reduced because I'm otherwise too weak to open them?  

It's the middle of summer, and I show up somewhere wearing a thick winter parka.  I complain that it's too hot and I demand the AC be turned up.  I refuse to take off my parka because it's my right to wear the parka, but my overheating will cause me medical problems therefore I need accommodation.  Is this reasonable?  No of course not because I'm creating a problem and demanding other people fix it (even when I can fix it for myself cheaper and faster).

If I drink too much at a party, and I'm still drunk or very hung over the next day and I can't do my job, should I be able to claim medical disability leave and get a paid day off?  No of course not, because the only reason I'm unable to work is because I made irresponsible bad choices the night before.

If I do a bunch of drugs and show up to work fucked up, and my manager fires me, should I be able to claim discrimination against a disabled person because my manager discriminated against my disability?  No of course not, because any 'disability' I have is the direct result of irresponsible bad choices.

If I get addicted and I have a continual habit of drug or alcohol abuse, should I demand special accommodation from my employer because of a disability?  No, because (while addiction is very real), it's still within my control.  My employer shouldn't be forced to pay for my bad life choices.

And food/weight is the same thing.  If I eat two McLardBurgers and a 128oz soda for lunch and again for dinner every day, pretty soon I'll be morbidly obese.  Should I demand that doors be made wider for me to fit through?  Should I demand a free scooter from the government due to 'disability'?  Should I demand airlines give me two seats instead of one (but without charging me extra)?  Why should I get these accommodations if someone who's 'disabled' due to drinking or drugs (also choices, just like food) does not get those accommodations?  

**Why should the drunk or the drug user be told to take responsibility, while the obese person gets a free pass?**

-----

Now this all said- there ARE legitimate medical conditions that directly cause obesity, and it's important to recognize their existence whenever on this subject.  Not everyone who's obese is just a fatass.  However it is the vast majority...","I have a couple different points to make, so this might not be very organized. But the context of when and how the discussion comes up matters.

1: Imagine you have a dude who doesn't have a leg because he carelessly cut is off with a hacksaw. Then you have an obese person who is too big to walk. They both go to a grocery store and there is one scooter. Well the amputee can't walk because he has one leg. The obese person could just stop eating so much, and maybe wouldn't be so big if they'd just walk. In fact, they probably SHOULD be walking. When people say obesity isn't a disability, I think it usually comes up in a context like this, where people try to use obesity as a way of getting out of basic activities of daily living or to get special accomodations. People generally don't like the idea of someone getting special treatment because they are too lazy to walk, or don't have the self-control to maintain their health. It's kind of more like someone who complains about being thirsty, but won't drink water.

2: Obesity can cause disabilities, but isn't a disability in and of itself. Again, people lose sympathy when it is something where people make a daily decision to stay that way. 

3: Sometimes people will blame their obesity on their health conditions, rather than their health conditions on their obesity. So when a person says they can't exercise because they have a bad back or bad knees or whatever else and that's why they're obese, the common sentiment is that ""no, you aren't disabled, you're just fat. Lose weight and you won't be 'disabled' anymore"".",1,1,True,"Response 1 is more persuasive because it provides a series of analogies that clearly illustrate the point being made. The analogies are relatable and help the reader understand the argument being presented. Additionally, Response 1 addresses the issue from multiple angles, making a strong case for why obesity should not be considered a disability.",0
"People will probably just become desensitized to the numbers. A long time ago $1000 was a huge sum of money, a year's salary even. Now, that is considered a relatively small amount of money to earn. The numbers only have meaning because we give them meaning.

Numbers in the thousands are too big for us to really feel and conceptualize. We will detach ourselves because it is impossible to imagine a thousand days of suffering all at once. Thus we will begin the desensitization process and this will probably end up having little effect on sentences. ","People have intuitive sense of how long 5 years is, because you can think about what you've done over past 5 years. People support harsh prison sentences because they don't feel empathy for the perpetrator of the crime, not because they don't grasp the magnitude of the punishment. ",1,2,False,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it addresses the issue of empathy and how people perceive time in relation to their own experiences. By pointing out that people can easily think back on their own actions over the past 5 years, it makes the concept of a 5-year sentence more tangible and relatable. This argument appeals to the emotional aspect of understanding the impact of a prison sentence.",0
"Here is the problem with chemical incapacitation: there is a reason why, in the real world, surgeries require an anesthesiologist to keep you unconscious but not dead during surgery, and why they are paid so highly: rendering someone unconscious without killing or permanently injuring them is very very difficult to do. There is a very narrow band, which is different for each individual person, that puts them under without taking away the possibility of waking up.

Okay, so what, why can't we make a standard dose for a gun?

The theory of police having a gun is that they use it when someone is threatening someone else with lethal force. If someone has a gun on either the officer or a civilian, if someone has a knife and is rushing the officer or a civilian, the officer has the gun to respond with appropriate force.

Let's look at what happens with a tranq gun in 3 scenarios.

In the very unlikely event that you have the exact right dosage: guy passes out. Probably not immediately, but maybe.

Dosage too high: you kill them. Not a huge difference from the gun.

Dosage too low: Uh oh, you still have a violent person charging you with a knife, and not enough time to draw a better weapon. You're probably going to get injured, and very well might die yourself.

The best worst-case scenario is the same as a gunshot wound. The worst worst-case scenario is cops getting killed left and right. The best case scenario doesn't have great odds, given the way dosages work with tranquilizers.

It's seriously just not a feasible weapon system, otherwise someone would be marketing it, selling it, and making a fortune.","Have you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance. This is because it's not easy to knock someone out, and it's even harder to do it without hurting or killing them. 

I'm no expert on tranquilizers but I know they are not the instant knock out guns movies make them appear to be. You have to get the drug in their system and it needs time to work. Time a person could use any number of ways, some dangerous.

Also, more importantly in my opinion, you're putting the person shot a risk. You're injecting an unfamiliar drug into their system. They could be allergic, or it could have an averse reaction with some other legal or illegal drug that they're taking. It could hurt them, cause permanent damage, or even kill them.

I fully believe in finding a solution to police killings, but this just isn't it.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a detailed explanation of the difficulties and risks associated with using chemical incapacitation as a weapon, highlighting the potential dangers and limitations of this approach. It also presents a logical argument comparing the potential outcomes of using a tranq gun in different scenarios, ultimately concluding that it is not a feasible solution. This thorough analysis is likely to be more persuasive in changing the OP's view.",0
"I've done a lot of advocacy work with rape victims over the years, as well as am one myself, and let me tell you - none of those things would have prevented the rapes I have been told about over the years. The vast majority of rapes occur in the home of the victim or the rapist, and the rapist is someone that the victim knows and trusts. Here's the sad truth - if you are a woman, statistically, you are more likely to be raped by your dad than a stranger in the bushes. 

If you really want to prevent rape, you need to focus on the vast majority of rapes. So that to me would mean things like bystander intervention, where you emphasize the need for bystanders to step in and seperate someone from a situation they think could be inappropriate, teaching about rape and sexual violence during sex Ed so people grow up understanding what the signs of an abusive relationship looks like and how to get out. Also so that people learn that sexual violence is not the victims fault and what steps to take if they want to report to the police. So many people are afriad to come forward and the recidivism rate for sex crimes is so high it's this horrible cycle of serial rapists who don't ever get punished and people keep getting victimized. Also there needs to be more education on consent, not only to teach what consent is, but to help empower young girl to feel comfortable saying no and that they don't have to do anything sexually that they don't want to. A lot of us get the message that we should just go along with whatever the guy wants even if we don't want that, which opens us up to predators who take advantage of that situation.  Anyways, my point is there are a lot of more effective things we could be doing besides telling people to be afriad of the dark, which people naturally are anyways btw.","I'm going to reverse the genders. 

How would you feel if you were told [this is how men should act to avoid false-rape accusations](https://i.imgur.com/7LXtLB5.jpg) ?

You would find it absurd. You would say it's absolutely stupid to adapt to a Dystopian society instead of trying to improve this society.

Many people have this misconception that rapes only happen to attractive and sexy dressed women in dark alleys. This is a cliche conveyed by Hollywood.

Rape doesn't necessarily comes from strangers, and it also doesn't only happen to women who dress up sexy. Many rapists do it more because of  domination/power/humiliation reasons than because the victim is visually attractive to them.

This means that when you start of the path of victim blaming, there is simply no limit because there is no point where women will be safe. It starts with asking people to dress differently and hang out in safe places, and it ends up with asking women to stay at home and cover themselves entirely.

Second thing is: women are *already* taking precautions, and they do NOT need a guide to know what to do. What they don't want is for the medias to present the rape situation as something women are partly responsible of. 

There are already too many people who still don't admit that rape is rape in some situations... and you want to perpetuate the idea that this is true? Your solution wouldn't make things better (as I said, women already know what to do), it would only make things worse.",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more compelling argument because it focuses on the root causes of rape and offers practical solutions to prevent it. By highlighting the fact that most rapes occur in familiar settings by people known to the victim, it shifts the conversation away from victim-blaming tactics like changing behavior or appearance. Response 2 also emphasizes the importance of education on consent, bystander intervention, and reporting mechanisms, which are proactive measures to address the issue of rape.",0
"Would you support a conjoined (Siamese) twin having the right to kill their sibling?  Are you compelled to share your blood and parts of your body for their sake?  (Let's assume that one twin is essentially independent and the other is more parasitic).  I'm talking age 20, say.

You've relieved the person of responsibility based on having had sex.  Keeping the twin alive is far more of a burden than a simple blood donation.

Shouldn't the twin have the right of bodily autonomy, even if you're killing a life, by your logic?","&gt; The best analogy I’ve heard is as follows

That was the worst analogy possible.  Following exactly that logic, we should allow women to have abortions but also arrest them for manslaughter immediately afterwards.  Your analogy dictates that a person cannot be compelled to take an action.  It doesn't mean that the person is not *liable* for their actions.

&gt;  Abortion should be legal, based primarily on my foundational belief on bodily autonomy. 

This is a logical inconsistency.  Bodily autonomy states that each person has the right to their own body but does not have the right to impact another person.  If we were to assume that a fetus is a person, then an abortion would be comparable to murder.  


For the record, I don't assume that a fetus is a person. However the foundations for *your* arguments on the matter are logically inconsistent.  ",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a direct rebuttal to the OP's argument by pointing out logical inconsistencies in their reasoning.

"This is like saying that the purpose of a surgeon is to cut people open. It's a description of a large part of what a surgeon does, but that's not the same as purpose. The surgeon can't say that their purpose is achieved just by virtue of taking a scalpel to the patient.

Same goes for the military. Killing people and breaking things is a means to an end, not an end in its own right. The military can't say ""We killed people and broke things. Mission accomplished."" if the desired political objective hasn't been met. Are you sure that purpose is the thing you're trying to argue here?","The purpose of the military is to accomplish the missions given to it. If that mission isn't best served by killing people and breaking things, then that isn't what they're going to do.

"The constitution is certainly flawed, but allowing amendments to be passed more easily would by no means fix it. The biggest barrier to improving our system is the *social* view of it as an immutable, timeless document (not at all what the Founding Fathers intended it to be). Were there at some point in history massive consensus that the Senate should be abolished, but only just under the 3/4-states limit, that would have been noticed, but such a consensus has never been there, only to be thwarted by the supermajority. Even if it were, changing the supreme law of the land is something for which is reasonable to expect a supermajority. These are rules beyond ordinary laws, rules which affect every person and state within our borders, and 51% of the country should not be able to make such huge changes.

Think about it from the other perspective as well. We have such a flawed system, how much worse would it be if those in positions of power could change it to their benefit with relative ease?

The major problems in the Constitution are not simple fixes that most amendments would cover, or that a lower-barrier-to-entry system to facilitate the changing of. IMO, the whole Senate can go. Maybe replace it with a proportional body. The increased feasibility in your model depends heavily on *how* amendments are made easier, and even then, the greatest barrier will be getting the public on board to make such a sweeping change. If you can't get enough of the public for a supermajority on board, as far as I'm concerned there is not enough consensus to ethically move forward anyway.","So I get the feeling you don't have that much of an understanding of the history of the Constitutions based on the points you made. First off:

&gt;The problem is compounded by the fact that making substantial changes to the document is difficult, if not to say nearly impossible in any but the best of circumstances.

There are a few points to unpack here. 

1. It is certainly not impossible, we have proven that 17 or 27 times, depending on how you view the Bill of Rights. Furthermore it was replacing a system, the Articles of Confederation, that was *practically impossible* to change.  

2. Next the Constitutions *should be hard to change*, as someone pointed out this is not the tax code. This is a document that provides both the underlying structural setup of our governmental system **and** codifies the ideals of nation into law. There should be a damn high barrier of entry to be a part of it. 

3. In addition, our system of government was designed to be slow, to make people think about the laws that were being passed. It's not a bug, its a feature.

4. Putting those together I would like to point out that the ratification system seems a good compromise to me. We don't want a system where a simple majority is enough any more then we want a couple states to hold us back. This says we need to show a much larger interest in it as a country. 

5. Easy Amendments take away from the Supreme Courts ability to make rulings. Part of what makes them powerful is that it is not simple to change the document, and that to do so requires near unanimous dislike and outrage. A strong court is good for the people be court is actually the best at reflecting the will of the people([weird](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2087255) I know, but [true](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/ten-miles-square/2013/06/how_the_supreme_court_responds045541.php)). 

&gt;Those combined factors mean that the U.S. may, slowly but surely, become backward compared to other countries with modern founding documents and laws. 

Please name a few. Honestly I am concerned by the fact other countries take a weak stance on Freedom of Speech. To the point where the Legislature had to pass the SPEECH Act. The abuses these ""modern"" countries allow concern me greatly. I would much rather our ""backward"" system. 

&gt;Unfortunately, failure to foresee that conditions in the future might warrant a radically different document means that the Constitution enshrines certain rights that make no sense in the modern day, and can indeed be harmful to the fabric of society, while ignoring others that are now far more relevant. 

Once again, be specific. I find this comments the most concerning because the are usually doused in uneven application of the rules and critical misunderstanding system. If your going to make these claims, don't hide behind ambiguity, tell us what you think these mismanaged rights are. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more nuanced argument about the flaws in the Constitution and the potential consequences of making amendments easier. It addresses the social perception of the Constitution as well as the practical implications of changing such a foundational document. Response 1, on the other hand, focuses more on defending the difficulty of amending the Constitution and questioning the necessity of change in the first place.",0
"Economically and socially, not having children when you have the means to raise them is a far more selfish act.

First, let's focus the discussion on the US, since that is where I assume you live.  After all, most of those 150 million orphans cannot be easily or legally adopted into the US, and those 800 million starving people is not because we lack food (we have a major surplus), it is about logistics and failed political states.

Anyways, in the US, there were only 101,666 children legally up for adoption in 2012, and of them 52,039 children were adopted. [Source] (http://www.ccainstitute.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=43) 

That contrasts the ~3.9 million babies born each year. [Source](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm)

In other words, the majority children in the US who can be adopted *are* adopted, and even if all of them were, it would not cover even 2.5% of the births that happen.

It is also important to note that even with all those births, the US doesn't meet its replacement rate.  That means that our population would be declining if not for massive amount of immigrants we take in.

Now, why is this important?  Because our economic and especially our social systems depend on new productive workers to enter the workforce as old ones retire.  Without them, the economy would collapse, social programs would go bankrupt, and we would basically experience a long depression until our population rates stabilized or increased.

Now why is it selfish?

Well, while society bares *some* of the cost of creating these new workers through free public education, the vast majority of the money and time used to produce them comes from the parents of the child.  

In other words, the parents are sacrificing their own resources to produce something that all of society needs.  This is the opposite of selfish.

Alternatively, a person who doesn't have children and retires is instead reaping the advantages of having those new workers work in factories and pay taxes for things like social security benefits and firefighters without having to contribute to making new workers themselves.  From a societal perspective, that is much more selfish.","The world has always revolved around people having children.  It is innate in our biological make up to want to have children and raise them.   If everyone felt like you did, we'd have an opposite problem. In fact, Japan does have that problem and the US could be not too far behind them some believe.   While true plenty of children could use a good home, that doesn't take away the biological desire to have your own children and the good that can come of having your own.    I can't see why you can't do both. 

I'm not so sure hunger is an over population problem as much as a logistics or greed problem.   We have plenty of food to feed everyone in the world now, we just don't distribute it correctly.   You sound like a smart person, we could use smart genes being passed down into the pool.  That is a helpful thing to society.  

Your last point is a strange one indeed.  I'm atheist, not agnostic, but we'll leave that argument for another time and place.   However, being as I am, I can really address your beliefs on that point as they're not mine, so I'd just leave it to say that's a really remote thing to concern yourself with over wanting to have kids.   

I love my kid.   Not only does he look like me but he acts like me too, its evident even though he's only 3.  I think the bond we'll have when he's older is far stronger than anything I could achieve if I adopted a kid, who I could love equally, but I'm not sure the same bond would exist.

"As a parent of two young children (2 1/2 and 4), I know that children can be highly unpredictable if their routine is broken. In a perfect world, I'd have my youngest in bed by 7:15 and oldest in bed by 9. That isn't always possible with life events (car is breaks down, need to wait by the repair shop, only place within walking distance for children is a family restaurant because they need to be fed. Or you're out for an extended family dinner, or whatever). 

I personally remove my children from the situation/area on the rare occurrences they pitch a major fit in public. I also get very annoyed with parents who ignore their kids in public places when they pull that shit. 

A customer, however, do not know the entire circumstances or get to dictate to me how I deal with my children. If I'm alone with my two children and one is having a meltdown in a restaurant, I need to get the second child at the table packed up to leave as well. If he's covered in food, that means a quick cleanup. He's likely to get pissed I'm taking him away from his food unexpectedly, and won't understand as he's 2. So now I might have two kids melting down. I might need to locate a staff member to tell them I'm not bailing on the bill or food, just stepping out to calm one of the kids down. This can take a couple minutes while I'm trying to keep the one having a meltdown calm. If you as a customer get antsy while this is happening and hit my kid, I'll punch your teeth out.

Not to mention there can be extenuating circumstances. I have friends with young children that have mild developmental and mental disorders that can make their behavior unpredictable. They're capable of leading semi-independent lives and their doctor/child therapist recommendations are to get the kids out and with others to start adjusting them to different situations. You have no idea if the kid is on the autism spectrum, and hitting them is the worst thing you can do.","Hitting someone else is never ""justified"".  Even if it causes their life to improve 500 times over you can't just hit people because you don't like what they are doing. Especially a child could be horrified of going outside in future thinking someone 10 times their size might just hit them to the ground when they're doing something. 

But verbally scolding them or telling them what they are doing is bad is fine in my eyes, but of course the mother/father will rightly so be angry you're going to upset their child. I highly doubt there would be many situations when the parent would feel happy you're treating their child bad. But you can let them be mad, you're..In theory..Doing the right thing, if you can take a bit of verbal abuse back at yourself and brush it off then go for it. Tell them to stop doing what they are doing and act properly. 


If there's a kid on the floor a waiter should speak up and ask ""who's child is this?"" and if they refuse to make him behave they should be removed from the restaurant. 




Basically I think your idea is fine but you'd be going about it wrong.  You should watch the movie whiplash, it has that kind of abusive relationship to force someone to do what they should be doing. I think you might like that, plus it's a good movie.

 If you watch that movie you might be able to see how the child would be feeling in that situation, doing something wrong and being scolded over and over until you finally get it right is a very hard process and most likely won't work unless the person wants to change or is forced to.  Most children will grow out of it and understand what they are doing is wrong once they're forced into a school where behaving normal would be enforced properly, until then it'll mostly be up to the parents.  Your efforts at trying to change them could work amazingly, but most probably be a waste of time. The best you can do is get them to be removed and explain politely to the parents they need to control their child. 

",2,2,True,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it provides a personal perspective and real-life scenarios that show the complexities of dealing with children in public. It also highlights the potential harm of hitting a child, especially when there may be underlying developmental or mental disorders. This response appeals to empathy and understanding of the challenges parents face.",0
"I think it is forcing your view on others.  

Sometimes that's ok.  For instance, it is my view that violent assault is morally wrong, and I believe it is appropriate to force that belief on others via the government.  So I support the criminalization of violent assault.

There are things which I think are morally wrong which I do not think should be criminal.  For instance, psychic readers are charlatans who part vulnerable people from their money with bogus and emotionally manipulative parlor tricks.  Being a psychic as a profession is fundamentally evil.

However, because the principles of free speech are so important, I am not ok with the idea of using government force to imprison people for doing this act.

You are holding two views:

1.  Abortion is morally wrong.

2.  Abortion is the type of moral wrong which the government should use force to ban.

It is possible to hold both of these views, or just number 1, or neither 1 nor 2.  I don't think you could hold 2 but not 1.

In any case, as to the example you gave about murdering a black person - yes, that is forcing your ideas on others.  But sometimes that's okay.  I won't go after whether or not you should think abortion to be morally wrong.  I won't even go after whether you think it should be banned by law.  But when you say something should be banned by law, you are forcing your ideas onto others, or at least trying to.  ","1. Can you cite an actual law guaranteeing all humans life? 

2. Abortion does not end a life, it stops a mass of cells from developing into a person. That's my belief, and I have actual science to back up my belief. Why should YOUR belief supersede mine? Especially when it comes to my right to make choices about MY life and MY body?

3. When you harass women outside of clinics, when you try to pass legislation dictating what they can do with their own bodies, when you try to pass legislation that endangers their lives, you are not just ""forcing your ideals"" on them, you're saying that you know better than them what is right for them. You don't. You're free to believe whatever you want to believe about when a fetus becomes a person, PERSON being the real key here, but you're not free to impose those beliefs on anyone's life but your own, nor should you EVER be free to do so. 

4. Unless you're going to care for that unwanted child you want to force some girl to carry in her body, risking her life and health for, for the rest of its life once its born, stop calling yourself ""pro-life"" and admit that you're actually only pro-birth. 

5. You ask ""am I forcing my ideals on others or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life""? The answer is yes. Both. You may well believe a fetus is a person from conception. You'd be wrong, but you can believe it. But here's the thing: by trying to pass legislation based on that belief, you're forcing your ideals on others. And in this case, that is not okay. 

",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a strong argument by appealing to the autonomy and rights of individuals, specifically women, to make choices about their own bodies. It also addresses the potential consequences of banning abortion, such as the burden of caring for unwanted children. The response effectively challenges the idea of imposing personal beliefs on others.",0
"I don't know if you live in the US or in the EU or whatever. But I think you miss something very simple. There is value in learning a language that you can use, there is less value in learning a language that you won't use. 

In the case of an European, (I'm taking the Dutch as an example) 
Germany is our biggest trading partner, there is value in learning German for economic reasons. Germany is bordering to us, increasing the amount of times we meet, there is value in learning German for social reasons, like vacations or friendships. which isn't there for Asian languages, because the people aren't vacationing that often in Asian countries as they do in our neighbouring countries. People that we meet in Europe often can speak an european language, even the ones that have origins in Asia, so it is easier to just keep to learning European languages if you are planning to stay inside of Europe. 

One of the best ways to learn a new language is immersion. It is easier to do so in Europe as an European. We have English, French and German as language options on TV for example. And if TV isn't enough we can just travel a few hours and go to a country where the language is spoken. While there is barely any chance to immerse yourself in Asian languages the same way.
","Here is the small problem. it is far easier for a Chinese person to learn fluent English than a western to learn any level of fluent Chinese. 

When those two meet, guess what the language will be?

English. 

I don't really advocate that it is better to learn Spanish than Mandarin, but I would say that there are a lot of people in China who know a little bit of Mandarin that are getting out compete by Chinese who speak English a lot better than westerns speak Mandarin. ",1,2,False,Response 2 provides a different perspective by highlighting the practicality of learning English over Mandarin due to the global dominance of English as a language. It also brings up the economic advantage of Chinese individuals who speak English fluently. This argument appeals to the OP's initial point about the value of learning a language that can be used effectively.,0
"&gt; (1) Huge swaths of Democratic blocs have little-to-no idea who he is.

That is okay at the moment.  His current goal is to recruit the activists who will help him organize volunteer campaigners in key primary states. In a half a year it will matter if most primary voters know who he is and in a year it will matter if most voters know who he is, but it doesn't matter if most people don't know who he is yet.

&gt; (2) Our economic problems aren't behind us by any stretch of the imagination, but we are slowly recovering and the media seems to be shifting its focus toward international affairs such as ISIL and Russia. Hilary has the advantage here as a former Secretary of State.

It is mainly the upper class that is recovering. Wages for most Americans aren't keeping pace and people absolutely do care about that. Sanders is a smart guy and has been in the Senate long enough to do better on foreign policy than most of the GOP candidates who primarily have experience at the state level.

&gt; (3) This one is a bit shaky, kinda sexist, and based on personal antidotes, but here it is. Mrs. Clinton is a woman.

I think that gives Clinton a bit of an advantage, but if you compare Sanders' policies to those of the GOP, Sanders' is much more aligned with centrist and liberal women's values.

&gt; (4) Even if Hilary gaffes and scandals her way out of the nomination and hands it to Bernie on a silver platter, Republicans are going to have a field day turning this into a shit show. Mud will be slung at the Radical Vermont Socialist who'll just continue Obama's policies. Corporate interests will pile the money on. The Baby Boomers will come out in full force and vote for whoever the GOP will push out simply out of fear. A good chunk of Americans don't believe in global climate change, how in the hell are they going to vote for a socialist?

It really doesn't matter how liberal the Democratic candidate is, *Republicans will do that anyway!!!!*  Sanders will have to clearly tell Americans what his policies and values are to combat the ""socialism is bad"" meme, but he has started doing a pretty good job of that.  For Sanders to have a chance he will need to have a large Obama-style group of volunteers to help get his message out, but he is on track to get those people. His biggest obstacle at the moment is that people like you who support him worry that he isn't a realistic candidate. If all the supporters like you were willing to spend a little bit of time helping get his ideas out he would be in very good shape to win the election.","&gt;(1) Huge swaths of Democratic blocs have little-to-no idea who he is. Working class Democrats, Blacks, Hispanics are all in the same boat. The only people who have a vested interest in him are college students and certain areas of the internet. No one seems to be addressing this huge discrepancy either, making the whole thing reek of another ""Ron-volution"".

This is almost always the case at this point in the election season; the only reason it appears to be more pronounced now is that you're contrasting his name recognition with Hillary's. Do you think people knew who John Kerry was? And yet even at this point, before everyone has announced their run, and before any debates, Bernie's support has grown dramatically. It's too early to say that he can't get his name recognition to the point where it needs to be.

&gt;(2) Our economic problems aren't behind us by any stretch of the imagination, but we are slowly recovering and the media seems to be shifting its focus toward international affairs such as ISIL and Russia. Hilary has the advantage here as a former Secretary of State. If something happens between now and the election, it would only further her lead.

First of all, I think you're dead wrong about the focus. Most debates are about domestic policy, because that is the policy that affects most Americans, and despite the upturn in the economy, it's still pretty bad; furthermore, it's not just whether the economy is ""good"" or ""bad,"" but specifically what Americans are pissed about, struggling with, etc., and when it comes to income inequality, saving Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, taxing corporations and the wealthy, student debt, workers' rights, money in politics, and other related topics, Bernie has more credibility and, if nothing else, more exciting positions than Hillary.

As far as foreign policy goes, she may have an advantage, but Bernie taps into the large swath of the Democratic Party (and Republican Party) that thinks we should stay out of the Middle East and let them deal with their own problems. Anyone who thinks in that way will be fine with Bernie not having been Secretary of State; add to that the fact that he's the head of the Veteran's Affairs Committee, and he'll have plenty to say.

&gt;(3) This one is a bit shaky, kinda sexist, and based on personal antidotes, but here it is. Mrs. Clinton is a woman. I remember in my class a few months back a straw pole my professor conducted an informal poll of who was going to voting for who and why. Almost unanimously (professor included) were in favor of voting for Hilary on the sole qualification that she was a woman and that would be good simply because it would signal to other women that they could have a career in politics. I don't necessarily agree with this mentality, but you can't argue that a lot of people will vote for her for that reason simply because of that ""progressive"" position.

Some might, but [polls thus far don't show much of an advantage for her with women](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/07/10/1400974/-Bernie-Sanders-Breaks-20-in-a-National-Poll-for-the-First-Time-Gaining-Support-Across-Demographics). His ""problem"" right now is mainly with 45-54 yr olds and African Americans, and that could have a lot to do with name recognition.

&gt;Republicans are going to have a field day turning this into a shit show. Mud will be slung at the Radical Vermont Socialist who'll just continue Obama's policies. 

Of course mud will be slung, but do you not think they have mud on Hillary? Her favorability numbers have *plunged* since the GOP began going after her, and they've got *decades* worth of material to use on her. What have they got on Bernie? He's a self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist. But they already kind of used up the socialist thing on Obama, and it didn't work. The American people heard that Obama's policies are socialism and said, ""If so, I don't mind socialism."" Granted, Bernie doesn't deny the socialist influence, but the policies of a Democratic Socialist country are not much radically different than our current system. Bernie just wants more government assistance for the poor, and less government assistance for billionaires. He's not trying to abolish capitalism. There will be mud slung, but he isn't afraid of his positions, and when people hear his positions, they tend to like them. Will he win the presidency? With this field of losers on the GOP side, I wouldn't count him out, but it's still too far out to guess: if I had to guess, I'd say no. But does he have a chance? Absolutely. He speaks in much the same way Obama spoke, and Obama was elected based on that rhetoric. He speaks in much the same way that FDR spoke, and FDR was our most popular president in history.

**tl;dr** Without being a fanboy, you can admit that he has a chance.",1,1,True,"Response 1 is more persuasive because it directly addresses the concerns raised by the OP about Bernie Sanders' lack of name recognition, his economic policies, and the potential attacks from Republicans. It provides a clear and logical argument for why these concerns may not be as detrimental as initially thought.",0
"&gt;I feel as though I'm lying to myself.

Why? And what 'technical standpoint' are you referring to? Gender is mostly a surface level set of assumptions we make about other people to orient which social norms we should apply when interacting with them. Sure, biology has some influence and in a *very* few realms, might be a concern, but in terms of how we treat people in a day-to-day environment there's no reason trans people are not their gender.","Trans people are not uniformly the same as their supposed pre-transition sex. There are *biological* differences between trans people and their pre-trans sex. These include genetic differences, and differences in the brain.

**Genetic differences found only in trans individuals:**

MtF Trans individuals have been found to have genetic differences that cause their biology to bind testosterone differently than males.

&gt;The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

**Brain structure differences found only in trans individuals:**

&gt;Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender.

and

&gt;The interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

**Prenatal androgen exposure:**

&gt;Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females

So no, they were not ""technically their own original gender"", because their original biological characteristics did not conform to a typical member of their supposed previous sex in the first place.

Does this help change your view?

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism)",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides detailed scientific evidence showing that there are biological differences between trans individuals and their pre-transition sex, which challenges the notion that they are ""technically their own original gender.""

"So, I looked into this on Lexis with a quick search because your question is an interesting one!  What I found is a large body of case law annotating § 1001 and reversing convictions for lack of materiality.  Upon a reading of these cases I do not believe that your example here: 

&gt; They ask questions which they know the answers to, can prove are lies, **and which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge.**

particularly because of the bolded portion, would support a conviction.  In other words, I believe the materiality requirement is taken quite seriously by the courts and acts as a safeguard which in most cases would prevent the abuse you are concerned about.  

There are an awful lot of cases dealing with this issue, published and unpublished, but here are a few quotes I thought most relevant and concise:

&gt; [T]he purpose of the materiality requirement of section 1001 is to exclude trivial falsehoods from the purview of the statute, since false statements that lack the capacity to influence a determination required to be made [by the agency] are too trivial to violate the statute.

*United States v. Wheeler*, 247 Fed. Appx. 558, 560 (5th Cir. 2007)

&gt; From the statutory history, it is evident that section 1001 was not intended to reach all false statements made to governmental agencies and departments, but only those false statements that might support fraudulent claims against the Government, or that might pervert or corrupt the authorized functions of those agencies to whom the statements were made. Typical of the kind of statements that are within the purview of section 1001 are false reports of crime made to federal law enforcement agencies that may engender groundless federal investigations.  The statute was not intended to embrace oral, unsworn statements, unrelated to any claim of the declarant to a privilege from the United States or to a claim against the United States, given in response to inquiries initiated by a federal agency or department, except, perhaps, where such a statement will substantially impair the basic functions entrusted by law to that agency.

*United States v. Bedore*, 455 F.2d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 1972)

&gt; Deciding whether a statement is ""material"" requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) ""what statement was made?"" and (b) ""what decision was the agency trying to make?""

*United States v. Gaudin*, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (U.S. 1995)

So if the FBI is asking you a question ""which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge,"" then a false response could not be material.  The state would need to prove that they were required to make some determination (in the case of the FBI, the resolution of a criminal investigation), that they asked you something in furtherance of the investigation, and that you knowingly gave a false response calculated to deceive them in a manner that would influence the outcome of the investigation.

Lots of legalese in there but I'm happy to discuss or post more!","IANAL but I think this is already included in the law. The law makes a misrepresentation of a **material** fact illegal. This means that the prosecutor has to demonstrate that the statement was false and that the false statement mattered to the investigation in a meaningful way. 

So I don't think lying to the FBI is a crime in the case where the lie does not matter. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a detailed analysis of the legal precedent surrounding the issue at hand, citing specific cases and explaining how the materiality requirement acts as a safeguard against the abuse the OP is concerned about. The inclusion of direct quotes from court cases adds credibility to the argument and shows a deep understanding of the topic.",0
"Don't you think its more bowing down and accepting the public (the people who *didn't* vote for you) has little confidence in you as a leader, so time to pave the way for someone new and hopefully more successful? A political parties aim, as a whole, is more power to do that which they think is right. If, at the top, you are a hindrance rather than a help, moving back into a backseat permission and bringing in a new leader can be more helpful to your party in the long run.

On top of that, if it was really just a power play, then surely they'd remain at the head of their respective party? Where else are they going to have as much or more power than they already do? Stepping down from the top spot is a relinquishing of power, which would run counter to your idea that all they desire is more power.","Political parties are interested in making (what they see as) positive changes to their country through the political system. They aim do this by gaining power through an election. The leader of the party is the face of the party to the public, as well as the leading force of the parties visions, views and how they conduct themselves. If the electorate rejects the party at an election, the leader may stand aside to give someone else a more likely chance of gaining power and brining about positive change. As clearly the public does not have faith in the party with them at the helm. In the modern era with 24 hour news coverage this is much more true now than it was before. It could be argued that a real power play would try to stay in for as many election cycles as you can get away with before being ousted. 

The Labour and Liberal Democrats suffered bad losses that reflected poorly on the party and their leadership. If the leaders had stayed on through this the public would have viewed them as desperate and a spent force around the time of the next election. In order for the party to bounce back as quickly as possible and start moving itself in the right direction, they will step aside. 

You must also remember that the leaders you mentioned have been members of their parties from probably 16/18 years old. They dedicated their entire lives to the party so it's fair to say they may take the view that stepping down will be in the best interests of the party if not their own interests. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 is more persuasive because it directly addresses the idea that stepping down from a leadership position is actually a relinquishing of power, which goes against the notion that political leaders are solely interested in power plays.

"WARNING Princess Mononoke Spoilers ahead!!!

Which films have you watched? I would say my two favorites are Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. With all of their films you have to first accept the fantastical world in which they live. There are ghosts, creatures, and spells. I'll try and give you a run down for what I love about Mononoke aside from the music and artwork (which I agree, are fantastic). I was going to do both but this one ended up long enough.

Princess Mononoke is a real out and out fantasty/action movie. It has very strong environmental themes, anti-war themes, and a number of wonderfully grey characters. Aside from Ashitaka everyone is flawed, proud, and stuck thinking that their way is the only way. No character is all evil or all good. There are strong women and men and each side truly believes in its cause.

The entire opening sequence is excellent. Ashitaka, the prince of a hidden and ancient people, spies something huge and evil coming towards his town. Him and his badass elk Yakul chase the thing down and kill it before it can harm the village but at his own sacrifice. He must leave and try and find a cure to the evil the beast poisoned him with. That evil (stemming from a bullet) is at the base of this movie. All at once it causes great suffering, but it also gives Ashitaka power and strength.

There follows a long excellent journey where he meets various people. It all culminates in the boars' suicide attack and the attempted killing of the forest god, a creature that is perfectly loved and serene. I don't know if you've watched this movie, but every time this scene comes around it affects me. It comes down to a war between nature and industry and as the heroes of nature and torn down in their folly you can feel how it affects many of the characters involved. This got a bit rambly and I have to run, might look it back over later.

As a quick note Spirited Away has a number of big themes as well as being a great film for children and adults (like the Pixar greats) and a stellar and compelling main character. Is it number 10 of all time like the list today on /r/movies put it? I don't know. But I do think they're both excellent.","This type of CMV is pointless. Nobody is going to be able to convince you to be retroactively moved by a film.

However, I can assure you that nobody is ""faking"" their love for these movies, as you suggest. Why the hell would people do that? It's not even as though there's some intellectual clout to be gained by claiming to like movies that are largely indistinguishable to non-fans from trashy mecha anime.

This isn't necessarily something everyone finds nice about the city.

"Lets start with ignorance, because I believe you're not representing it properly, and aren't fully thinking through the implications of what your suggesting.

Ignorance does not stem from closed mindedness, but rather, lack of knowledge. You, and every other human on earth are ignorant about many things in the world. Being ignorant has no effect on your openness to new ideas, in fact, people who are ignorant could be considered a blank slate. Perhaps a better word for this would be inconsiderate or insensitive?


Being closed minded is essentially being resistant to change, and that's not always a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy thing, and in certain circumstances, it makes sense to adjust your willingness to be persuaded. It is in some ways necessary to our survival, and has been a factor in allowing us to survive this long.


As for punishing ignorance, that's not a proportional response. People's brains are not capable of comprehending everything that's happening in the world, and ignorance is necessary. The weight of all of the suffering, sadness, and tragedy in the world is not something people are equipped to actually all comprehend at once.


peoples instincts and emotions do strongly influence them. You're desire to use violence is a perfect example of that. I agree that in our current society, mistreatment of homosexuals is a serious issue, and we should be educating the ignorant, and attempting to persuade the insensitive, but that doesn't mean we should expect ignorance to away completely.","So from what I gather from your story, you wanted these people to be physically punished because they....hurt your feelings? I understand fighting (in a literal sense) for rights and equality under the law, but you aren't entitled to live in a world where people don't judge you. 

What you consider ""ignorance"" might be completely different from what someone else considers ignorant. A vegan might see meat eaters as being ignorant for causing pain and suffering to animals. But a meat eater may see a vegan as being closed-minded by judging people for the manner in which they obtain a basic human necessity. You can't label a certain opinion (and a group that holds that opinion) as ""ignorant"" and deserving of violence because you simply don't hold the authority to decide which opinions qualify as ignorant. And what about the people who are quietly ignorant? They may not openly laugh at you on the street but they still think of you as scum and spread their agenda. Do they deserve violence too? Even though they've done nothing but have an opinion?

Again, you do not have the right to live in a world where people don't judge you. But people do have the right to an opinion, and they should not be subject to violent repercussions just because they hold that opinion.

Lastly, how do you fix ignorance? That's like asking how do I fix people's opinions who don't agree with mine? You don't. Let them have their shitty opinions, and choose not to give them the time of day.",2,1,False,"Response 1 presents a strong argument by highlighting the importance of freedom of opinion and the dangers of resorting to violence to combat ignorance. It emphasizes the idea that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, even if they are considered ignorant by others. The response also questions the effectiveness of using violence to change people's opinions and suggests that it is not a productive solution. Overall, Response 1 provides a well-reasoned argument against punishing ignorance with violence.",0
"Do you use the word ""Goodbye""? Even though it has its etymology from a contraction of the phrase ""God be with ye""?

If you are looking for a perfectly rational reason as to why we say ""Bless you"" after a sneeze, you won't find one. As you have already hear from other people in this thread, it is a cultural carry over from earlier times, and we do it out of convention. 

Similarly, the secular usage of Merry Christmas or Goodbye can be applied to ""Bless you"". You don't have to literally mean that you wish to bless someone in a divine sense, you can apply it as a cultural custom.

Other languages have different words for a post-sneeze polite convention, but none of them are objectively useful.

Gesundheit (German) and Salud (Spanish) both just mean ""health"", so they are a bit more direct to the point. But even then, they don't say ""salud"" when someone coughs, only when they sneeze.

It is an illogical social custom, like many that we have, and you should just conform to it where it benefits you. If you think that you are in a situation with people that will get annoyed for you not saying it, just do. It's silly, but not as silly as getting into an argument with your mother for no reason, or potentially offending a polite host at a dinner party or something.","It's just a modern colloquialism. You don't need to believe in god to say Merry Christmas. You don't need to view this as congratulating a sneeze, it's clearly evolved to become a modern, polite colloquialism. It doesn't mean you are saying anything about demons or congratulating a sneeze or what have you. If I said, ""Thursday was awesome"" and you agreed, are we paying tribute to Thor? The word 'awesome' also has historical use as a religious word to describe something great about god. My grandma would make fun of what she called the ""religious  nuts"" of her day who would go around using the phrase awesome in the early 20th century.  Language evolves. ",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more comprehensive explanation by comparing the phrase ""Bless you"" to other cultural conventions like saying ""Goodbye"" or using different languages for post-sneeze responses. It also acknowledges the illogical nature of the custom and provides practical advice on conforming to it in certain situations. This approach is more likely to appeal to the OP's rational thinking and address their concerns about the phrase.",0
"You aren't totally wrong about it. Anecdotal advice is the reason Amazon values its reviews so highly. People do find a lot of value in reading another person's experience. I'm one of them: I bought the watch that I'm currently wearing after reading over a dozen user reviews on Amazon. 

However, unlike with scientific evidence, you should be much more skeptical about relying on anecdotes. There are plenty of fake reviews on Amazon. In fact, there are so any that Amazon has [had to take action](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazon-files-first-ever-suit-over-fake-reviews-alleging-calif-man-sold-fraudulent-praise-for-products/). So proceed with caution and try to get a LOT of feedback so that you aren't influenced by false or misleading reviews.","Essentially, anecdotal evidence is too little evidence. Think of reality as a connect the dots drawing. Each item of anecdotal evidence is a dot. Now then, with say two or three dots, can you tell that the picture will be a car? Of course not. The person supplying that data point could have just been extremely unlucky or extremely lucky. However, when you have say 500 dots, then you can clearly see that the picture will be a Ferrari.  This collection of anecdotes collectively is empirical data. you can perform statistical analysis on it to find am average trend. Rather than seeing just a point, you now have a view of the entire bell curve. If someone was unusually unlucky, you will be able to tell and know that in reality, it's a solid product. Likewise, if someone has been unusually lucky, you can also tell and know that you will most likely get a bad product.

",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more balanced perspective on the issue of anecdotal evidence. It acknowledges the value of personal experiences in decision-making, but also warns about the potential pitfalls of relying solely on anecdotes. By mentioning the prevalence of fake reviews on Amazon and advising caution, Response 1 presents a more nuanced argument that takes into account the limitations of anecdotal evidence.",0
"Some situations are grey when there really is no objective right or wrong, when two different people can come to completely different conclusions about the ""rightness"" or ""wrongness"" of a situation. Something that is often grey is giving to charity. Perhaps you're aware that giving to charity is thought to be kind and generous by one group, and indulgent and wasteful by another.

Say you've managed to save some money in the past few months to buy a really nice pair of sunglasses for the summer. It's your money, you're free to do with it as you want. But that money could literally help save lives of children in other parts of the world. So what do you do? If you decide to go ahead and buy that really nice pair of sunglasses I don't think it would be wrong, and if you decide to donate that money that wouldn't be wrong either. Or what if you buy a decent pair of sunglasses instead of the really good ones, and donate the saved money? That would be a compromise b/w two ""good"" things.

It's often a matter of how much information you have regarding any issue that makes something grey. I don't doubt that there are some things that are definitely ""good"" of ""bad"" according to my own perception of morals. The more I know about an issue, the more arguments from two sides, they more grey something becomes.","There's been a lot of debate about it in recent times but I firmly believed the issue was resolved in 1967 by the work of Professor Eastwood.

His logical and philosophical considerations have left no doubt that in addition to the ""good"" and the ""bad"" there is also the ""ugly"".",2,2,True,"Response 2 provides a more nuanced and thought-provoking argument by presenting a scenario that challenges the OP's perspective on right and wrong. It also introduces the concept of grey areas in morality, which can be a compelling way to shift someone's viewpoint.",0
"Your entire argument sees human life from an instrumental perspective.  If life were just dollars and cents followed by investments for more dollars and cents then your argument would be pretty ironclad.  

But what if government's role is *not* to mimic business?  Instead government intends to create sustainable societies where all members have an opportunity for a life worth living.  The thing about that statement is that *all members* means **all members**.  

If life has not just an instrumental value, but an intrinsic value then it is our duty to protect it.  Inversely if life only has instrumental value, then we do not need to protect it in other senses either.  If it's cheaper to send 40x as many soldiers as it is to build better weapons then we just throw soldiers at the problem.  If it's cheaper to threaten the lives of workers than to demand that they wear protective gear then we just throw people into the machine.

Most people would agree that life itself has a value.  You are attempting to draw the line at the types of lives which have value while disregarding the rest in some sort of culling. ","All of your points are rooted in a broadly utilitarian philosophy, which holds that whichever action increases utility is the morally correct one to make - in the case of your argument, it is mainly economic utility. It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, ""it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong"". And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.

To look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. 

As for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population. ",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a more comprehensive argument against the OP's utilitarian perspective by highlighting the importance of maximizing pleasure and societal esteem, as well as the government's duty to protect its citizens regardless of economic benefit. It also addresses the Malthusian argument presented by the OP. Response 1, on the other hand, focuses more on the intrinsic value of life and the dangers of drawing lines on which lives have value.",0
"Frivolousness (the actual legal term) is a really high bar. 

There are two types, factual and legal frivolousness.  For factual frivolousness the Supreme Court [has held the standard to be as follows.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9141408508548092395)

&gt;[A] court may dismiss a claim as factually frivolous only if the facts alleged are ""clearly baseless,"" 490 U. S., at 327, a category encompassing allegations 33*33 that are ""fanciful,"" id., at 325, ""fantastic,"" id., at 328, and ""delusional,"" ibid. As those words suggest, a finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them.

This case is clearly not factually frivolous under that standard.  The facts alleged were that the plaintiff was burned (true) by coffee that was hot (true), that was above industry temperature standards (a plausible assertion of fact), and that McDonald's willfully made its coffee hotter than standard (a plausible assertion of fact).

As far as legal frivolousness, this is defined [as follows:](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=868429855339617087&amp;q=legal+merit+frivolous&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33)

&gt;an appeal on a matter of law is frivolous where none of the legal points are arguable on their merits.

In this case, there was at least a plausible case for tort negligence based on the alleged facts.  It might be a case that's a likely loser, but as long as there's some level of sane argument to be made, it's not frivolous.","Frivolous has a very limited meaning, and this lawsuit does not qualify.  To be frivolous, a lawsuit must have no merit.  But here, McDonald's deliberately set the temperature of their coffee to one that could cause tissue damage (&gt;110 degrees F).  Had they set that coffee to a temperature under 110, it would be highly unlikely that any damage would have ensued.  So they are at least partially at fault in any scald injury.  Liebeck did indeed suffer a scald injury, and she did so by exposure to hot McDonald's coffee.  With those elements satisfied (McDonald's had a duty to safeguard its customers, it took an action that conflicted with that duty, she suffered injury, and the injury was caused by McDonalds' action), the case is not frivolous.

We might want to live in a world in which coffee can be served above 110F without fear of lawsuits.  I happen to enjoy McDonald's coffee.  That desire doesn't change the definition of frivolous, however.",1,2,False,"Response 2 provides a clear and concise argument outlining the elements necessary for a lawsuit to be considered frivolous, and then applies those elements to the case at hand. By breaking down the components of the case and demonstrating how they do not meet the criteria for frivolousness, Response 2 effectively refutes the notion that the lawsuit against McDonald's was frivolous.",0
"Depends on the type of freeway really. In some places I'd be wary of cutting over to the leftmost lane to pass some people if it is 3+ lanes. In my anecdotal experience that's when you have to watch out for those guys the most. In all cases, I find it best to let the fastest drivers pass you, since (as others have noted) it is the safest thing to do as it deters tailgating and it reduces the chance you'll get pulled over for speeding yourself (even if you are already going well over).","Traffic is generally safer when going slower. Traffic is also generally safer when there is little variance in speed, ie everyone is going about the same speed.

It seems intuitive to me that a larger variance in speed of different drivers would contribute to more accidents than a slower speed. Ie, if everyone was going 90 +/-5, there would be less accidents than 80 +/- 15. I have no stats to back that up and I very well might be wrong, but from my experience I believe this to be the case.

If that is correct, in order for the population to have the safest possible driving, people should drive as close to the average as possible. Driving too far under will cause more accidents. If that average happened to be high, as it seems in your case, you might be able to reduce variance and in effect reduce accidents by going faster.",2,1,False,"Response 1 provides a logical argument backed by the idea that a smaller variance in speed leads to safer driving conditions. The OP also acknowledges that they have no stats to back up their claim, but their reasoning is sound and based on personal experience. Response 2, on the other hand, focuses more on personal anecdotes and strategies for driving safely, but doesn't directly address the argument made in the original post about speed variance.",0
"The information that you describe, tips like ""travel in well-lit, well trafficed areas,"" ""be aware of your surroundings,"" ""don't travel alone,"" etc, are helpful for preventing other crimes like mugging, which is more likely to occur. This advice as a way to prevent rape is not practical.  When you give these tips to women as ways to prevent rape, you are giving useful information to half of your population for a situation that is not very common.  (Also, the advice is really obvious.  People are naturally uneasy when alone in the dark.) You are better off presenting the advice to everybody as a way to prevent mugging or other more common crimes.

Rape is overwhelmingly committed by someone the victim knows.  The ""jumping out of the dark"" type rape is rare compared to ""date"" rape.  When people talk about teaching others not to rape, what they mean is ""one should know that having sex with an inebrieted person is wrong; having sex when someone is uncomfortable is wrong, etc.""  Rape cannot be a crime of need, which is why there are no ""teach people not to steal"" campaigns.

You can't give tips on how not to be murdered, you can only teach people to think murder is wrong.  Likewise, in order to prevent rape, you should teach people who have sex to be considerate of their partners' consent.","Here's a different angle: No, anti-victim blaming culture is not suppressing rape prevention information. The common activist is smart enough to tell the difference between blaming the victim and telling people to be careful.

The ""teach men not to rape"" meme/campaign/trend is mainly focused on spreading education of consent in situations involving heavy drinking, drugs, and ambiguous/difficult to read situations.

As several people have already pointed out, rape is not very often a crime involving ambush and assault, at least not in this age.

Even the most toxic activist movements have yet to attempt to shut down women's self defense classes or weapons marketed towards women (unfortunately in some cases, as certain weapons and defense measures are totally ineffective)

There certainly can be a much better method of spreading this and similar messages besides confronting the innocent with accusations (""schrodinger's rapist"" and ""@yesallmen"" spring to mind), however, there have been no notable instances of even the most hardline ""SJWs"" actively suppressing self defense and rape prevention information. More often than not, the messages you're referring to are spread by ignorant young girls, high school teenagers or victims of toxic group dynamics that nobody honestly listens to anyway.

In summation, the only people for whom self defense and rape prevention information is being suppressed are the ones spreading this information in toxic activist communities.",1,1,True,"Response 1 provides a more nuanced and logical argument by pointing out that rape is often committed by someone known to the victim, making traditional prevention tips less effective.

"I'm a little late to the party, but want to present the issue a little differently, so here goes:

As the issue involves two competing rights, the legal system in deciding this issue needs to apply an Oliver Wendell Holmes-style balancing test. The two competing rights are:

1. The right of the child to receive financial support from his/her parents
vs.
2. The right of the father to decline financial support to a child he did not consent to father

I specifically say financial support, not fatherhood, because courts do not (and cannot) force a father to be ""involved"" in a child's life; they can't force the guy to love the kid. The courts can compel the father to pay money, though; the issue is a financial one.

Since the two rights stated above cannot co-exist, the state is forced into a decision because whether the state acts or not, it will be promoting one party's rights over the other.

1. If the state *acts*, and compels the father to pay support, it is promoting the rights of the child over the rights of the father, vs.
2. If the state *does not act*, and allows the father to withdraw support, it promotes the rights of the father over the rights of the child.

Thus, the balancing test: forced into a decision between promoting one party's rights over the other, the state balances the benefits and detriments of deciding in one party's favor.

This issue is usually presented as the rights of the child outweighing the rights of the father. I actually look at it from sort of the opposite way- it's not that the rights of the father are less that the rights of the child, its that **the father is better able to bear the burden of having his rights deprived than the child is**. Thus, the courts decide in the child's favor.

Example of what I mean: Say a father earns $3000 per month, and his hypothetical child support payments are $500 per month- a huge chunk of his income. If the state acts and compels the father to pay the child support, it is significantly burdening the father by depriving him of 1/6 of his income. *However* (and it sounds shitty to say, but) the father also has the *ability* to recoup the $500. The father can aim for a promotion and increase his salary, or take a second job. The father has the ability, in theory, to recoup the money the state has deprived of him.

The child, on the other hand, has no such ability. Children cannot work, so if the child loses out on the $500, that $500 is gone. Thus, the father, through his theoretical ability to earn more money, is better able to bear the burden of being deprived of his rights, and the courts rule in the child's favor.

Important notes!:

1. I understand how shitty it is to say ""oh, the father can just take a second job."" This is *not* an ideal solution to the issue; it is a balancing test choosing between the lesser of two evils, the evils being depriving one party or the other of their rights.

2. As such, a better solution is a stronger social safety net. In an ideal world, a single mother would receive enough support from the government to negate the impact of losing the father's financial support. If this were the case, I could see the argument that it shifts the balancing test in the father's favor. As it is, however, with so many single mothers raising their children in poverty, there is clearly not a strong enough social safety not, and so the balancing test is applied as is.

3. The *best* solution, however, is to prevent the situation from happening in the first place. This means (a) comprehensive sex education in schools and (b) widespread access to affordable (or better, free) contraception. In Colorado, a program that gave free IUDs to low-income women dropped the teen-pregnancy rate and abortion rate by nearly half each. This also, undoubtedly, had the effect of forcing fewer fathers to pay child support to kids they didn't want.","The ability to prove paternity is a fairly recent one, and while I'm *not* going to claim men being forced to take responsibility for children they never wanted to father is a new thing, men being able to ditch women they impregnated by up and leaving with less and less ease is.

It sucks that life's not fair. It sucks that men can knock up women and then have no say in the matter over whether a child is born or not, and have to pay to support their unwanted children based on the mothers' wishes. It's not fair that women get to deal with pregnancy and men don't. It's not fair that men are able to physically remove themselves from a pregnancy situation and ditch the woman to deal with it however she can best. It's REALLY not fair to grow up with one of your parents never acknoledging you exist, leaving you at a disadvantage assuming the mother isn't either wealthy or lucky enough to have a very good support network/social safety nets to rely on. It's not fair that this argument comes up as a comparison to women being allowed to control what they do with their reproductive system, as though that's the same as a man controlling his wallet.

This is adulthood. Being a responsible adult means a few different things for biological men. Sucks, but there it is.",2,2,True,"Response 2 presents a logical and balanced argument that frames the issue as a conflict between the rights of the child and the rights of the father.
